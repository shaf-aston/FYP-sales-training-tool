VoiceCoach AI - Vision & Impact Document
The Problem We're Solving
Every day, millions of professionals face high-stakes conversations - sales calls worth thousands, medical consultations affecting lives, job interviews determining careers. Yet traditional training methods fail them:
•	Performance Anxiety: 73% of people fear public speaking, making peer roleplay traumatic
•	Scheduling Nightmare: Coordinating practice sessions wastes 5+ hours weekly
•	Inconsistent Feedback: Human feedback varies by mood, experience, and bias
•	Limited Practice: Most professionals practice less than once per month
The result? $75 billion in lost sales annually, 40% of medical errors from poor communication, and countless missed opportunities.
Our Vision
VoiceCoach AI democratizes elite conversation training through AI-powered voice roleplay that's always available, never judges, and provides world-class feedback.
Imagine a world where:
•	A junior salesperson practices with "difficult customers" at midnight before a big pitch
•	A doctor rehearses delivering difficult diagnoses with empathy
•	A job seeker perfects their interview answers with instant feedback
•	A manager practices giving constructive feedback without fear
