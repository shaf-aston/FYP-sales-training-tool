HEY ___NAME___  this is just ___ from ____PARTNER____ you recently booked in a call for now about possibly getting help with your health and fitness. Is this an appropriate time? 

Age, height and weight please

And what weight would you ideally want to get down to?

When were you last at [GOAL] weight?

(Ok well do you know what you’re looking for specifically? Rough goal 

Let’s give 1-2 sentences)

The Engagement Stage (85% of the sale is made here)

Situation Questions – (finding out their present situation)

No more than 3 - 4 otherwise they feel interrogated

What are you doing now to possibly  [lose weight] (or get healthy can I ask)?

And how long have you been doing it that way?

I’m curious, what caused you to do that?

Problem awareness – (Open the emotional door to find out what their problems are, what caused them, and how its affecting them)

So do you… do you… like the training and nutrition plan you have in place now? Slightly skeptical – furrow your brow ( training and nutrition -= labelling their current strategy)

Lean into YES

*If they say no:* well it can’t all be bad, what do you like about XYZ?

Oh, what do you like about it?

If needed:

Is there anything else you like about it?

Two truth- (nobody likes 100% of what they do or have)

Generic: 

So to me it sounds like things are  going   faaaiiirly well for you, is there anything you would change about your (present situation or the results that you are getting), if you really could though?

If they expand on what they don’t like:

Clarifying questions:

What do you mean by that? How do you mean by that?

Probing questions:

How long has that been going on?

Has that had an impact on you(r)(ability to stay on track)? / Has that affected your consistency to stay on the grind all the time?	 				    	    In what way though? 

(Sounds like you’re a bit on a hamster right? What do you mean when you say you’re bit on a… hamster wheel? – (ties into Nutrition Pillar))

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TONE (weeeeelllllll wait one minute)

Just so I can see the rationale behind why you might be looking  to INSERT GOAL, but besides having a (repeat back what they told you they want) what’s the main reason why you’re looking to really [streamline this process] (now) rather than doing it the way you have always been doing it/ doing more of what have been doing already?

SPECIFIC PROBLEM QUESTIONS BASED ON THE ABOVE EXAMPLES HERE

How much weight have you lost since you had the baby? And how much weight would you want to lose if you could though? (this is where you get the goal) Tease it out to be SMART

Insert lifestyle factors

Ok so I think that I understand what you are possibly wanting to achieve. Can you walk me through a typical day of eating and training for you?

How many meals do you eat per day?

Is that Monday to Friday, is it different on weekends?

So you EAT X amount of meals per week?

Of those meals how many do you cook yourself?

So you cook x amount. What do you do for the other ones?

- Ok so we have an acronym that helps us find low hanging fruit that is possibly taking you away from your goal 

F

R

Breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, coffee, ciggies, meal out, bought meals, takeaway, BOOZE

H/B

!Are you open to reducing some of those activities to get to your goal faster?            		OK WHY?

The last thing to check would be stress. Stress plays a huge role in weight loss. We find with our clients that the 2 most common are finances and partner. Does your partner know that you are on this call today? Or are we a on a bit of a secret mission?

Is your partner supportive of you learning the skills to get XYZ so can XYZ?

With the finances, are you guys ok atm? I want to make sure that we can help in anyway possible and this can be a pretty big stressor for some and really effects weightloss….

I know with covid everything’s a bit crazy, with finances I don’t want to pnl your tax statement, just want to know like if there’s any external stressing points we need to work with so we can use specific stress reduction techniques.

Have you got experience in the fitness industry?

Yes – ask what and either move on or stay here

No – stay here

(Price shock)

Have you got experience in the fitness industry? 

Yes - ask what and either move on or stay here 

No - Stay here

There are 3 types of training

1 on 1 in person or online 

Large group or bootcamp 

Small group PT

Example of what to say

"We do mostly one on one training but to understand why, I will give you some info on the others. Large group is great, it is really good for people looking for fun and fitness. Its a large group doing generic but good exercise. It's cheap and cheerful and costs about $30-40 a week

and that's great but maybe not super relevant for you given your goals. You have small group training which can be amazing but doesn't really give people that type of individual attention needed when you first get started. Oftentimes when people think of one on one training they think of celebrity trainers or physical therapy at 150-250 per session. Because we don't bill insurance like a PT would we don't have to charge enough to cover insurance costs. You get the personalisation of 1 on 1 but the frequency and fun environment of the groups, and you can train with us 2-3 times a week for about the same price as 1 Physical Therapy session so 139-199 amount per week. So you can see how doing it that way gives you the best chance to get a result right?

(you can change it around to fit any of these just hit the best part of your product and the worst parts of the others)

Josh Largey Checklist:

age weight and height- stretch

When last at ideal weight, how does it feel not being there for last 10 years

Work - movement, stress, impact on life

Who's at home- taking care of them

Holiday - can you go on holidays, afford it?, how did the holiday feel

what are they supplementing, what are they deficient in and are they really supplementing it or they're guessing?

Hook into WHY NOW with leverage

Solution awareness – (Involves your potential customers and their ideas which strengthens the benefits of them changing their situation with your solution)

(actually just shifting gears slightly)z before you started talking with me… were you out there looking for ways to lose the weight so you could [What they said they wanted (e.g have more energy for your kids)] &orrrr what were you doing?

If they say no

I’m curious, whats prevented you from doing that in that past?

If they say yes

How did it work out for you with that company/coach?

What type of results did you get with them?

What do you think held you back from having success with that strategy/approach?

IF they say yes, but didn’t go with them (identify non buyer language)

Ok what prevented you from going with that company?

Let’s do this just to make sure that what we are doing would actually work for you but besides ___________ and ___________ what are you actually looking for in training and coaching programs, what would be your… uhmm… ideal criteria?

Probing:

Why is that important to you… now though?

optional:

is there anything else you’re wanting?

Now tell me about the [main pain point], you had mentioned you wanted to [insert main goal] What would be your ideal weight or lifestyle, what would you really want to achieve?

GET THE REAL GOAL

Ok so with what you are doing now, and be real with me but how close are you to being to, not only get to but also maintain that goal weight over the long term? (plug in what they said they want to make) -- > Ok but Why though? 

What can happen if they make the change

So lets say we were able to help you get to XYZ weight in the next [16 weeks], what would you do that you maybe struggle to do now? (they will say, play with kids, wear nicer clothes etc) - SKEPTICAL tone

What would that do for you personally to be able to do that? (they will give you feeling/emotional answers back)

Probing Questions (based on their answer)

What do you mean by (insert emotion from above)?

Does that mean are [now happy] now?

Well how long has that been going on?

Has that had an impact on you and your family?

In what way?

_________________________________________________________________________________

Well how would it be different tho, by being XYZ that (plug in what they said they want), how  would your life be maybe different then… than it is now? (logical question)

How would that make you feel though?-(Matt writes) What would that mean to you? (brings out their emotion/feelings)

Probing statement:

Ok so that’s important for you to do something    then?

Or Time to make a change possibly? REAL SKEPTICAI

If needed

Ok but why now though?

TONE (slow it down, low tone, assertive, concerned)

Consequence Questions- (Helps your prospect question their way of thinking and explores the consequences of not solving)

Now to consider the other side of the coin…. Is what will happen if you don’t succeed? I know you think like me and its not even an option in our heads but in reality it is an option. What if you are NOT able to fix this and you just keep doing the same things over the next 2 days, 2 weeks, 2 months, 2 years, 2 decades?

_________________________________________________________________________________

If theyre not complying: 

They have to explore failure to accept success

(Can try Burning building Analogy if want to)

Deer and bear analogy

So which animal gives up first? 

Why?

So the motivation &or perceived motivation is outweighed? And one thoing that really drives the deer is the vivid detail. The knowledge of what will happen the moment that Bear gets its claws into it…

So we all know that person- single mum, 4 kids, 6 pack, 7 figure business and we ask ourselves. What are they putting in their coffee?

It’s a good dose of FEAR and reality

If you understand the real life consequences of failure then you have MORE motivation to act

_________________________________________________________________________________

Positive emotion or negative

They say, well that would make me so happy

Does that mean your maybe not happy with this area now?

Yes

What do you mean by Not happy

If negative:

Are you willing to settle for that?

Well whose choice is it if you settle or not?

So you want to change your situation and start losing the XYZ so you can XYZ or would you rather stay where you’re at?

IF NEED WHY NOW: 

Well, why is that so important to you now though? OR Why now though, why not do it later (and push it off)?

Transition Formula- (Transition into presenting your solution)

Well based on what you’ve told me, what we are doing might actually work for you…

With your permission I can go over a few things that we might be able to do for you, to help with your situation, to solve some of those problems

Here is what we can do for you… the program is $3600 for   26 weeks and for that   this is what we will do for you

FEATURE – BENEFIT – PROBLEM IT SOLVES

PRICE AND TERM NEAR THE TOP

Pillar 1

Based on what you've shared with me. There's actually three things I think will help you...

(First and foremost) You know how you mentioned insert negative problem #1 for the past 3 years..

Well we solve that with our insert method so that you can fast track insert positive solution.

Which means you'll be able to insert benefits. And ultimately all that means for you is, you can insert payoff. Do you feel have that strategy in place would solve that?

Pillar 2

I love it, so to make it even more exciting and makes it pair so nicely with our first pillar. What you mentioned earlier about not having insert negative problem #2 and how it prevented you from being able to insert solution they wanted?

So naturally when you said that I knew this would be helpful. We call it our insert method PROPERLY combining both insert pillar 1 and insert pillar 2 is the main reason some programs fail→ and its the main reason we get such fast results.

Which ultimately means you'll be able to insert benefit so you can insert payoff. Can you see how those two things sort of work hand in hand?

Pillar 3

Amazing, so just the insert pillar 1 and the insert pillar 2 alone is enough to put people on a path to insert result, however, what I feel really ties everything together and what the data has proven for us, and what we want is to ensure, LONG TERM success, so we added in our insert pillar 3.

You know this process we are taking you through has helped thousands of people reach success, so to lock in that success, that's exactly why we add an accountability coach which means you'll acquire all the knowledge skills and tools that you need so that you can actually insert payoff.

Ultimately, we are here to give you the support and guidance you mentioned you needed to really give you a guaranteed outcome.

Can you see how all three of these working hand in hand together is different from what you've tried before?

Goal and nutrition – eating to lose weight, and training for strength: you won’t get any of them. A lot of people don’t know how to do that. They don’t know differences between super setting & trisecting, different rep ranges & set ranges, time and retention. I eat because I’m sad and I’m sad because I eat.

Pillar 1 Nutrition(personalised)

I

The reason why we give you a personalized nutrition program is because we want to ensure that what you're eating is actually going to work for you and that it's not just a cookie cutter approach where everyone gets the same stuff. Okay? Because you know how you said that you've kinda been struggling with losing weight/bloating.

So we're gonna make sure that all of that is sorted and it's totally fixed and you aren't gonna have those problems again, make sense?

Does that make sense?

Pillar 2 Training(individualised)

We are going to have a personalized training program for you. The reason why we have a personalized training program is because every body is different and you have your own unique needs and goals we will accommodate for. We will put you through a full

N

body assessment to determine what level your body is at and build you a program based on your results. How does that sound?

Does that make sense?

Pillar 3 Accountability

I heard you say you are struggling to hold yourself accountable and it sounds like you need and (put their reasons here) to start making some positive changes. Is this correct? We do this by matching you with one of our coaches who is matched with your personality by taking a personality test to see who best would work with you, they will be checking in with you daily and weekly depending on your preferences. How does that sound?

Q to you Shaf, where will you have this in the call?-->

Squat double your body weight or looking good in the mirror or running 5km faster, I could snap my fingers and make that happen, which one will it be? *Mirror* Ok so we’re looking for more aesthetic weight loss.
