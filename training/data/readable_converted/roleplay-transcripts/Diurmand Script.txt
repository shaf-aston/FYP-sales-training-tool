# ROLEPLAY TRANSCRIPT

Connection & Context Phase

Introduction

Use this section to help the prospect relax into the call. Nothing they do can phase us. We are here to help. “Water off a duck's back”

Hi, is this [NAME]?

Hey, this is just EDIN from PRODUCT coaching... looks like you had booked in some time with us about possibly getting some help to lose weight and get the most out of your supplements… Is that right? [CURIOUS]

Now I know you had recently purchased some supplements from us… do you mind if I ask what problems you were facing that caused you to do that? [CURIOUS]

Yeah so I’d say the first part of this call is pretty basic… it’s more for us to kinda see what you’ve been doing to lose the weight in the past and what results you’ve gotten from that… compared to what your actually trying to achieve… just so we can see what the gap looks like… and then from there if there's any guidance or support I can give you to make sure you are getting the best results possible I can walk you through that… would that help?

Current Situation 

Use this section to get context on their current situation

Great… So what age are you?

Perfect, and what is your current bodyweight?

What weight would you be hoping to get down to, if you could?

How long has it been since you were [GOAL WEIGHT]?

Why do you feel you’ve struggled with your weight during that time? [CURIOUS]

Problem Phase

Past Experience

Use this section to ask about what they have done before and to find out why it didn’t work or why they didn’t stick with it.

BASIC: Use this section to ask about what they have done before and to find out why it didn’t work or why they didn’t stick with it.

ADVANCED: We also need to look for patterns and identify what limiting beliefs may exist

Ok so obviously supplements are going to be a helping hand… but for most people they are really just one small piece of the puzzle… So what have you tried previously to fix this? Have you followed any formal nutrition or exercise plans?

If they give a list

Ok and out of everything you’ve tried… which was the most successful in terms of weight loss?

How much did you lose?
Are you still following it now?

Why not, if you don’t mind me asking?

ANd those X Pounds that you have lost did u keep them off or did u gain them back? 
Okay. So yeah, you've had some success losing weight, but you've never been able to get all the way to your goal and then keep it off long term.

Do you have any idea maybe why you didn't get results/ NEVER BEEN ABLE TO KEEP IT OFF? 
Okay I guess like everyone can lose weight IT pretty much always comes down to either something we're doing or not doing

IF THEY HAVE NEVER LOST ANYTHING OR HAD VERY LITTLE SUCCESS THIS IS POTENTIALLY A RED FLAG

EMOTIONAL EATING: 
What's behind that?

In what sort of situations do you notice that behaviour happening?

How long has that been going on for?

Have you ever had help with xyz so you could stop doing that when xyz happens?

Do you feel like if you could stop doing xyz that it might make it a little bit easier to xyz goal and actually maintain it long term?

Got you makes sense...

>> Make sure you understand the specifics of the problem

GO DEEPER ASK WHY IS THAT SO

If they say it is unsustainable etc.

Ah ok so [PROBLEM THEY SAID]...didn’t really feel like something you would want to do for the rest of your life?

If they have tried lots of things and you want to check for pattern

Ok and what about XYZ… was that much of the same or what happened there?

IF THEY HAVE LOST WEIGHT / HAD SUCCESS MULTIPLE TIMES BUT ALWAYS GAINED IT BACK THEN THAT IS A POTENTIAL RED FLAG

WHY NOT DO IT THEMSELVES

Use this section to prevent the DIY objection

Supplement Pre-handle

Ok well forget about us here for a moment… I am really just asking this for you… but I guess just so I can understand your thought process a little bit… do you see yourself battling with your weight… taking supplements/diets for the next 5, 10, 15, 20 years?... or are you more so on the look out for something a bit more permanent where you can lose the weight and keep it off forever?
 SHORTER VERSION
And do you see yourself taking supplements/doing  restrictive dieting for the rest of your life, or are you're looking for something a bit more permanent,  where you can lose the weight and keep it off forever?

DYI- PUT ASIDE THEIR THING -XYZ  

Oh Yeah that makes sense 
INTRODUCE COACH -   And just so I am really clear like have you ever had a  coach before or someone to show you how to actually lose the weight and to keep it off forever or have you always tried to figure it out yourself?

Okay, I'm curious like what's maybe held you back from maybe getting a coach or getting outside help before now?Okay,I t
 Aha ok and I am not talking about us particular, you know but like if it meant that you could get faster results you could actually lose all of the weight, and keep it off for the rest of your life.

And again I'm really not about us, BUT IS that something you'd be potentially open to exploring if it meant that you could get sustainable results?

Yes, okay, but like why now? You know, why not just keep trying to figure it out on your own  like a lot of women do that never lose the weight?
SHORTER VERSION
And I'm not talking about us, but if it meant that you could find a permanent solution, like, is coaching something you'd be open to for a short period of time, if it meant that you could lose the weight and keep it off forever?

USE YOUR CONVERSATIONAL FLEXIBILITY AND SKILLS AND POKE HOLES IN THEIR LONG TERM PLAN IF NEEDED

WHAT ELSE DO THEY WANT? - EXPAND ON SOLUTION ONLY IF NEEDED

Ok and I guess if permanently losing the weight is your… main goal…. besides [WHAT THEY SAID THEY NEED]… let’s say we were to sit you down with myself and the coaches and actually map this out for you step-by-step... in terms of like… the amount of time you have available… the level of support and accountability you need… or the resources you’d like us to provide… what do you feel you would really need… from someone like us… so that this was the last time you ever had to lose this weight?

Challenge Phase

Why Now / Call Out

Use this section to make them justify why they want to make a change now 

WARNING: This will come off weird if they are actively trying now so make sure it is appropriate to ask.

ADVANCED: We can use this section as an opportunity to call out any redflags we may have heard earlier in the call (e.g. scam, wary, skeptical, fear of failure, limiting beliefs)

“Call out” >> Only if appropriate

Ok and I know that you had mentioned XYZ previously… do you mind telling me a bit more about what caused you to say that? [CURIOUS]

________________________________

“Why Now” >> Only if appropriate

And before purchasing the supplements… how long has it been since you… like last.. actively… tried to lose weight? [CURIOUS]

If longer than 3 months

What’s been holding you back from trying before this? [CURIOUS]

Ok but I guess… why now though? Why not just keep pushing this down the road… like most men / women do who never lose the weight? [CHALLENGING /SKEPTICAL]

Emotional Phase

Current State

Use this section to understand their current pain 

Ok but I guess besides the obvious… just trying to get healthier… trying to get fitter… what are the reasons… behind… wanting to lose this [WEIGHT]? [SLOW DOWN + CONCERNED]

NEED CURRENT PAIN

Ok… but just to bring it back to the current situation… is carrying this extra weight… what kinda of… an impact has on you?

In what way?

GO DEEPER - THOUGHTS
Like what makes you say that specifically? What your health looks like at the moment that's making  you want to be healthier.

How often do you think about your weight? Is this like a daily thing?

In what way… what exactly goes through your mind?

EXPAND THE TIME FRAME

How long has that been going on for?

ADVANCED: GO TO THE DEEPEST LEVEL - INNER PERSON (IF IT FEELS RIGHT)

Ok… so feeling like that / dealing with [PROBLEM]... for X years… has that been having an… effect on… on you?

Future State  

Use this section to help the prospect see their life if all of their problems were SOLVED

Ok, and suppose that in X weeks/months time we were able to help you [REMOVE THEIR PROBLEMS]... just like we have with other women / men… How would your life… be different… than it is right now? 

GET SPECIFIC TANGIBLES

ADVANCED: HOW WOULD THEY FEEL?

Ok so if you were to imagine yourself… X months from now… you’ve have lost X… and you’re [WHATEVER EXPERIENCE THEY WANT]... when you picture yourself in that situation…having become the version of yourself that you want to be… how do you… feel?

Cost of Inaction

Right… and my concern is… what happens if you never fully commit to yourself and never go out there and get the right help so you can learn the right skills that you need… and you keep gaining weight… and [MAKE CURRENT PROBLEMS WORSE] get even worse… What would that be like for you?  [CONCERNED]

Commitment

Ok so time to make a change… possibly? [CONCERNED]

Ok and I guess before we go any further… just to double check… is losing the weight and keeping it off sustainably… is that… is that 100% what you’re really hoping to achieve this time around? 

PITCH

Transition to Pitch

Ok so it’s important for you to solve this once and for all, that’s all I really needed to know cause based on everything you have told me… I think that what we’re doing could / would actually work for you…

Because you know how you said you want to lose [WEIGHT] and at the moment you are struggling with [PROBLEMS PREVENTING THEM FROM LOSING WEIGHT]

and… because of that, it’s causing you to feel… I think you said… “a little bit”  [EMOTIONS] // “like you might need to make a change”...

WAIT FOR RESPONSE

Pitch 

So what I can do is give you a walk through of how we could actually help you with this… would that help?

GIVE A BASIC OVERVIEW OF THE LOGISTICS AND GOAL

NORMAL PITCH

So the program focuses on life-long change and to do that we have two phases…

So during the first phase you would have your own personal coach that we would pair you with and your coach would actually specialize in helping [PEOPLE LIKE THEM WITH THEIR PROBLEMS].... So you’re exactly the type of person we help… So with that coach you would be working with them 1:1 so that you can create a lifestyle that would allow you to [GOAL] but far more importantly... to teach you to actually maintain that long term. 

Ok?

So that initial phase lasts an absolute minimum of X Months But we would work with you until you have achieved the goal weight you set with your coach when you start.

Make sense so far?

So your coach would provide you with a tailored updated plan every single week 

but you would actually be working with them daily to make sure that what you are doing is 
1) effective, 2) enjoyable, and 

3) that we provide you with a tonne of support & accountability so that you can actually be successful.

Ok?

The first pillar is that our program needs to be effective… what I mean by that is that you need to be able to get consistent results from day 1 all the way until [GOAL / FUTURE STATE]…because if you aren’t getting really consistent results it is going to feel like a complete waste of time.

Absolute bulldozer of certainty. 
You know the way that you're doing a lot of right things and you're not getting results.And that's really frustrating.

 Well, we're going to show you 
exactly where you're going wrong. 

We're going to show you exactly what to do, when to do it, how to do it.

So it's not a question of if you can lose this WEIGHT It's just a question of when, but we need to give you that blueprint

We need to show you the exact steps, so you never have to doubt yourself again.So losing the weight won’t be a mystery to you and you won't feel frustrated anymore.

And you will never have to ask yourself, are you doing the right thing? You know every single moment, every single day, exactly what to do so that you can achieve your goal.

So we need to give you a really simple, really easy, really clear plan that you CAN ACTUALLY  follow that's going to get you to your goal.

No questions asked. Does that make sense

LINK TO THEM & SOLVE THEIR PROBLEM

Cool, so the second pillar is that it needs to be enjoyable… like it seems pretty obvious when you say it out loud… but it is where everyone goes wrong… if you don’t enjoy what you are doing to lose the weight or it doesn’t fit into your life… it’s only a matter of time until you stop… and what happens then?... You just fall back into old habits and gain back the weight right?... That seems pretty pointless to me. 

LINK TO THEM & SOLVE THEIR PROBLEM

Cool and if you were getting consistent results and had someone working with you to make sure you were actually enjoying what you were doing and that you never had to do anything you didn’t want to do… do you feel you could stay consistent with that so that you could [GOAL]... and keep it off?

Ok and the final pillar is that we need to provide a tonne of support and accountability… I mean like…who are you accountable to at the moment?... right and it is so easy to let yourself down… it’s much much harder to let someone else down… especially when they are there purely to make sure you are successful… it’s about having someone to give you encouragement and reassurance so you know you are on the right path and feel motivated… someone to answer your questions at any time so you know how to navigate situations as they come up… and having someone to give you some accountability so you don’t give up on yourself and if you do struggle… which is totally normal from time to time… because nobody is perfect…We are all human… right? So it is important that you have someone to lift you back up and get you back on track… but the key is that they can figure out what went wrong and fix the underlying issue so it doesn’t keep happening in the future… [SOLVE THEIR “DEEPER” PROBLEM IF APPLICABLE]... 

Do you feel if you could stop [PROBLEM] that would make it easier to get to [GOAL] and stay there?

Yeah that’s why that makes such a difference… On top of that you would also be part of our community where you would be surrounded by like minded women who are all chasing similar goals. This will keep you feeling motivated and inspired.

So what this all means for you is that we will help you to create a healthy and sustainable lifestyle… something we want you to think of as your “new normal”. One where you can [GOAL + REMOVE PROBLEMS] but more importantly you [FUTURE STATE]… and that is where phase 2 comes in… in phase 2… we give you ongoing support, knowledge and education to help you transition to the point where you don’t need us anymore… So you can maintain your results long term… We are massive believers in the idea that if you do it right… you only do it once.

Does that all make sense?

Checking For Fear Post Pitch

Use this section to check for fear & value objections - this is your last chance.

So I guess…do you feel like this… could be… the answer for you? [UNCERTAIN]

IF YOU CAN SENSE ANY DOUBT / UNCERTAINTY (EVEN 1%)

I can sense just a little bit of hesitancy… What would be making you feel uncertain?

Why do you feel like it is though? [SKEPTICAL]

ARE THEY 100% BOUGHT IN?

Ok so you feel like if you had [EXPAND ON WHAT THEY SAID THEY WANT]… that would put you in the best position possible to [GOAL]. [CERTAIN]

ARE THEY 100% BOUGHT IN?

Closing

Okay so at this point I don’t really have anything else to go over with you… It looks like we’ve covered the basis of what you were looking for… So the next step would be to have a chat about the investment and then at that point we could get you set up on our systems, and set you up with your coach. From there we would just work together until you [GOAL + PAINT PICTURE OF FUTURE LIFE]. Would that be appropriate?

Cool, the once off upfront investment if you were to do it in one go is just $2000 /1500$ / $1200…

SCHOLARSHIP - 900$ PIF or - 97$ per month

$1200 PIF OR  - 130$ per month = 1560$

 $1500 PIF  25lb guarantee 3 mo + 3 mo // $162.5  over 12M for 1500$= 2000$ OR
334 - 6m 

35lb guarantee 4 mo + 12 mo  // 
 PRICE  2500$- 3000$  OVER 12 M= 270$

45lb guarantee // 5 mo + 12 mo = $3000-4500$ - PIF 
3250$- over 12 M = 325$

55lb guarantee // 6 mo + 12 mo = $4500

MONTHLY - 487$ = 3900$

65lb guarantee //7mo+12mo= 5000$
75lb guarantee // 8m+12mo= 5500-6000
85lb guarantee // 9m+12mo= - $6500-$7000
95lb guarantee// 10m+12mo=   $7500-$8000
105lb guarantee// 11m+12mo = $8500-$9000

Now we can of course break that up… but most people generally prefer to invest the full amount upfront… if they can…  as they save roughly $500.

Do you have any questions about that?

Ok so would it be better for you to do it up front and get the best possible value or would you be thinking you need to break it up a little bit?

SPLIT IT UP - CHECK FOR FEAR BEFORE OPTIONS

Yeah that’s not a problem… We can really tailor it to the person so it really depends on what you need in terms of breaking up the investment… but besides from finding the best option for you... do you feel that you… want to be part of the program?

Uncertain answer

I can sense a little bit of uncertainty… if we were to put the money aside for a second… what would be making you feel uncertain?

If they say yes

Makes sense… so is it more a question of how we can make it work as opposed to if you want to do the program?

Ok well just to see if I can help you on this call… if you were to think about it a little bit… is there a way that we could break down the investment that… would… work for you?

If you get an option that works and you are happy with then take it

No worries… well one way we could do it is half now and half in a month… I could even potentially get you some of the savings if we were to do something like that… would that work or do you feel you might need to split it up a little bit more? $1100 / $750

Ok well one way we could do it is we could split it up over 3 months… would that allow you to get the help you need so that you can [GOAL]? $800 // $533

_________________________________________________________

Presenting an option

Ok well one way we do it is we can split it up over x months… [You can add on options below as appropriate]

#1 Link to goal

would that allow you to get the help you need so that you can [GOAL]... 

#2 Give an easy out
or do you feel you might need to split it up more?

______________________________________________________

Drop Selling

Right… I guess my concern is how are you ever going to [GOAL] 

if you never get the help you need…?

Ok so well look… before I see if there is anyway I can actually help you with this… besides from not being able to afford the options we have discussed… you 100% want to join the program?

And you’re not just being polite? (HAHA)

Ok so just to see if I can actually help… after housing, necessities, food,  basically everything you absolutely NEED to survive… if you were to reprioritize your life and your goals a bit so that the focus was actually on your health… how much do you feel you would be able to afford per month if it meant that you could [GOAL]?

Ok well what if… hypothetically… we were able to reduce the weekly investment to $125… would that allow you to get the help you need so that you can [GOAL]?

Ok well if it means that you can actually get the help you need I can do that for you… does that sound like it could work?
