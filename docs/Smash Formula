## Phase 1: Intent
Get tangible and experience
Hey can you hear me can you see me?
Whats up buddy, how's it going?
(SUPER casual) Cool man well It looks like you booked a time about possible help with {desired outcome}? How can I help?
Ok and what do you feel like you need help with in specific.... like in order to {desired outcome}?
= tangible
_________________________________________________________________________________
What have you seen that makes you feel you don't have X?
= experience


Logical Certainty
Get cause, problem, and probe
What are you doing for X that's causing {experience}?
How long have you been doing X?
What caused you to do X in the first place?
= doubt
_________________________________________________________________________________

Do you like it? Like besides (negative tangible), do you I guess like {process}?
If Yes: (super curious tone + upward inflection) Oh What do you like about it?
If No: It can't be all terrible if you've been using it....what do you like about it? 


Ok it doesn't sound like terrible then... I guess is there anything you would change about like the {process) or (result)? like if you... if you could though?
=problem
_________________________________________________________________________________
What do you mean? / How do you mean? / Meaning?
How long has that been going on for?
Has X had an impact on Y?


Emotional Certainty
Identity shift and future pace
Ok and just so I see your POV besides (problem you already uncovered} whats the rationale behind even looking at like a way to get more X.... rather than just doubling down on what you're doing now with {current strategy), like the average person would?
Ok and in regards to that, before you and I were speaking were you out there looking for other ways to get {what you're selling e.g. mentoring or more leads} or what were you doing about that?
- What prevented you?
- So what's shifted now?
Identity frame – (situational)
Yeah and the reason I ask is because there’s a big difference between wanting to be that {20K 30K month} and actually understanding + doing what it takes to actually become that guy. Because I can think of being that guy all I want, but it's not until I take the actions necessary, I won’t become that guy. I'll give you an example, how much do you want to make? 									             How far are you from that? 
so Everything you've done - your mindset your skillset has got you to 10K a month. 
It's not what's gonna get you to 20k, because otherwise you'd have been already done that. So is it worth keeping the same skillset- the mindset that's got you 10K month. Like is that worth it? Why not? * I will be stuck* coz what will happen if you continue being {stuck} right?

So then tell me what you want right, because I'm a Big Believer that if there's a big enough reason to do something and a Big Enough Consequence of not doing it-- that's what gets people to actually DO stuff. The overweight person doesn't workout until they know they’ve got two months to live.
So you getting to x what does that you do for you?

FP
Lets say there was a way of possibly helping you with solving X.... what would tangibly be different for you / your business at that point? 
-	Get 2-3 tangibles/specifics that would be different about their life)
And you accomplishing X.... step into those shoes for a second.... what would that do for you.....like personally though?
COI
So tell me one thing man because you have a big enough reason to why you want to do this thing. At the same time so does everybody, everybody's got a family. But what changes is when the consequences are so big when this is either sink or swim and it's really dire. God forbid, if your mom had three months to live, you would have a whole different level urgency than what you have now.
So on the flip side... what happens if you don't? like what actually happens if we continue down the current trajectory with X (problem... for the next 2 days, 2 weeks, 2 months, even 2 years?
- Get 2-3 tangible/specifics
And how would you like....feel at that point?
Pitch
Commitment to change, pillars, and sell themselves
So this'll sound like an obvious question but its not. Are you willing to settle for that?
And why now? There's always the new year new me guy. Start a diet on a monday. Why actually draw that line and make that change? Cause ya haven't for the past months
And whose responsibility is it?
_________________________________________________________________________________
Based on what I've heard man of {problem} and {goal} I think what we're doing for sure could help you... if it would be appropriate from here we can put a game plan together of how to actually get you to {goal. Would that be appropriate or what do you want to do?

Go into 3 pillar pitch and add context to each pillar
_________________________________________________________________________________
Based on what I've covered do you feel like this would actually get you to GOAL?
Ok and why though?
So the total investment man to actually get X so you can {goal} is $SS. How would you like to proceed?
