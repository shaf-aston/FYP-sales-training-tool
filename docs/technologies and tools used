# Technologies and Tools Used

**Document Purpose**: Comprehensive list of all third-party dependencies with justifications for each choice. Demonstrates adherence to "use existing libraries" principle and provides traceability for dependency decisions.

TECHNOLOGIES, TOOLS, FRAMEWORKS, MODULES AND LIBRARIES USED IN PROJECT
=================================================================================

BACKEND FRAMEWORK & API
-----------------------
- **FastAPI**: High-performance async framework for building RESTful APIs.
  - Simplifies API development with built-in validation and async support.
- **Pydantic v2**: Data validation and serialization library.
  - Ensures type safety and automatic validation for API requests/responses.
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
  - Provides fast and lightweight server capabilities with hot-reload for development.

CONVERSATION LOGIC
--------------------------
- **KALAP v2 Framework**: Custom rule-based conversation engine using deterministic logic.
  - "Start Simple" approach. Provides stability and control without LLM complexity.
- **rapidfuzz**: Fuzzy string matching for intent recognition.
  - Industry-standard library for keyword matching with typo tolerance, reducing custom code.
- **jinja2**: Template rendering for dynamic question generation.
  - Simplifies string formatting in question routing, following library reuse principle.
- **textblob**: Sentiment analysis for response scoring.
  - Lightweight library for basic sentiment detection in answer validation.

VOICE & AUDIO PROCESSING
------------------------
- **Web Speech API**: Browser-native Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech.
  - Free, privacy-friendly (client-side), and requires no backend infrastructure.

DATABASE & STORAGE
------------------
- **In-Memory Storage**: Python Dictionaries (`ContextTracker`).
  - Rapid prototyping. No database setup required for current development phase.

FRONTEND FRAMEWORK & UI
-----------------------
- **React**: JavaScript library for building the chat interface.
  - Enables dynamic and interactive UI development.
- **Fetch API**: Native browser HTTP client.
  - Standard, no external dependencies like Axios needed for simple requests.
- **CSS Modules**: Component-scoped styling.
  - Modular and maintainable styles without heavy frameworks.

DEVELOPMENT TOOLS
-----------------
- **Git**: Version control system.
  - Manages source code and collaboration.

TESTING FRAMEWORK
-----------------
- **pytest**: Testing framework with markers and fixtures.
  - Enables organized unit and integration testing for regression validation.
- **pytest-asyncio**: Async test support for FastAPI endpoints.
  - Handles asynchronous test cases in the testing suite.
- **pytest-cov**: Coverage reporting tool.
  - Provides detailed test coverage metrics for code quality assurance.

PROJECT-SPECIFIC SERVICES
-------------------------
- **ChatService**: Orchestrates conversation logic.
  - Handles response generation and connects API to KALAP logic.
- **VoiceService (Frontend)**: Manages Web Speech API interactions.
  - Encapsulates browser-specific voice logic.

API ROUTE MODULES
-----------------
- **routes.py**: Core endpoints (`/chat`, `/health`, `/conversation/{id}`).
  - Centralized routing for the MVP.

DATA MODELS
-----------
- **Pydantic Models**: `ChatRequest`, `ChatResponse`.
  - Defines strict contracts between Frontend and Backend.

CONFIGURATION
-------------
- **Hardcoded Constants**: Currently used for simplicity.
  - "Start Simple" philosophy. Environment variables to be added as complexity grows.
