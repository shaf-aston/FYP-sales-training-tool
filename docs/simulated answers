INTENT PHASE
Timestamp: 0:00 - 2:15
Rep: "Hey can you hear me, can you see me? What's up buddy, how's it going?"
[0:15] Mike: "Yeah, yeah I got you. Good man, how are you?"
________________________________________
Rep: "Cool man, well it looks like you booked a time about possible help with building an ecommerce business? How can I help?"
[0:25] Mike: "Yeah, so I've been in construction for like 12 years now and honestly, my body's starting to feel it. I'm looking to build something online, you know, ecommerce seems like the move. I just... I don't really know where to start or how to actually make it work."
________________________________________
Rep: "Ok and what do you feel like you need help with specifically... like in order to build a successful ecommerce business?"
[0:55] Mike: "Honestly man, it's everything. Like, I don't know how to find products that actually sell, I don't know how to run ads without blowing my money, and I definitely don't know how to make it consistent. I need like a step-by-step system that actually works, you know?"
TANGIBLE: Need structured system for product selection, profitable ad management, and consistent revenue
________________________________________
Rep: "What have you seen that makes you feel you don't have that system?"
[1:30] Mike: "Well, I bought this course like 8 months ago for like 200 bucks. Watched a few videos but it was all over the place. I tried setting up a store, picked some random product, spent maybe $300 on Facebook ads and got nothing. Like literally two sales that barely covered the product cost. Made me feel like I'm just throwing money away and I don't know what I'm doing wrong."
EXPERIENCE: Previous failed attempt with cheap course, lost money on ads, feels incompetent and uncertain
________________________________________
LOGICAL CERTAINTY PHASE
Timestamp: 2:15 - 8:45
Rep: "What are you doing for product research that's causing you to pick products that don't sell?"
[2:35] Mike: "Honestly? I was just scrolling through AliExpress looking at stuff that looked cool. I picked this camping gadget thing because I thought it was neat. Didn't really do any research on demand or anything. I just guessed, basically."
________________________________________
Rep: "How long have you been doing this trial-and-error approach?"
[2:55] Mike: "I mean, that one attempt was 8 months ago. After that flopped, I kinda got discouraged and haven't really done much since. Just been watching more YouTube videos and thinking about it, but not actually doing anything."
________________________________________
Rep: "What caused you to try ecommerce in the first place?"
[3:20] Mike: "My buddy from high school, he's crushing it with some online store. He's making like 30, 40K a month now. Drives a nice car, travels, works from his laptop. Meanwhile I'm waking up at 5am, busting my ass in the heat or cold, and my back's always hurting. I'm thinking, if he can do it, why can't I? But clearly there's something he knows that I don't."
DOUBT: Knows someone successful, feeling left behind, lacks confidence in ability to replicate success
________________________________________
Rep: "Do you like it? Like besides losing money on ads, do you actually like the process of ecommerce?"
[4:05] Mike: "You know what, honestly I don't really know yet because I barely gave it a real shot. But the idea of it? Yeah man, I love the idea. Building something that's mine, not trading hours for dollars, being able to work from anywhere... that's the dream."
________________________________________
Rep: "Oh what do you like about it?"
[4:25] Mike: "The freedom aspect, for sure. Like, right now I'm stuck on site 10 hours a day. With ecommerce, even if I'm working a lot, I could be home, I could be at my kids' soccer games. And the scalability, you know? In construction, I can only supervise so many guys. With an online business, if I nail the formula, I can scale it without breaking my back."
________________________________________
Rep: "Ok it doesn't sound terrible then... I guess is there anything you would change about the process or result if you could?"
[5:10] Mike: "Yeah, I'd want to know exactly what I'm doing. Like, I want a proven system. I don't want to be guessing on products or throwing money at ads hoping something sticks. I want to know: this is the product, this is how you test it, this is what a winning ad looks like, this is when you scale. Like paint by numbers, you know?"
PROBLEM: Needs proven system, clarity, and step-by-step guidance to eliminate guesswork and wasted money
________________________________________
Rep: "What do you mean by 'paint by numbers'?"
[5:50] Mike: "Like, I don't need to reinvent the wheel. I just need someone to show me exactly what works, and I'll follow it. I'm good at following processes—that's literally what I do in construction. We have blueprints, we follow them, the building goes up. I want that same level of clarity for ecommerce."
________________________________________
Rep: "How long has this uncertainty been going on for?"
[6:20] Mike: "Man, probably a year and a half? That's when I first started really thinking about this. But the actual failed attempt was 8 months ago, and since then I've just been stuck in analysis paralysis."
________________________________________
Rep: "Has this uncertainty had an impact on your motivation or your family?"
[6:50] Mike: "Yeah, definitely. My wife sees me watching videos and researching stuff late at night and she's like, 'Are you actually going to do something or just keep watching?' And honestly, it's frustrating because I WANT to do it, but I'm scared to waste more money or time on the wrong thing again. So I'm just... stuck. And meanwhile, I'm still dragging myself to the job site every day knowing there's gotta be a better way."
________________________________________
EMOTIONAL CERTAINTY PHASE
Timestamp: 8:45 - 16:30
Rep: "Ok and just so I see your POV, besides needing a proven system, what's the rationale behind even looking at a way to build an ecommerce business... rather than just doubling down on construction and maybe getting more certifications or moving up in the company, like the average person would?"
[9:15] Mike: "Because there's a ceiling, man. I'm already a supervisor. Next step is maybe project manager, but that's only like 80, 85K a year and I'd still be on sites, still be grinding. I'm 34, my body's already feeling it. I see the older guys, they're 50, 55, with bad knees, bad backs. That's gonna be me. And there's no real wealth building in construction—I'm trading time for money. With ecommerce, I can build an asset. Something that can run while I sleep. Something I could eventually sell. That's real wealth."
________________________________________
Rep: "Ok and in regards to that, before you and I were speaking, were you out there looking for other mentoring programs or coaching, or what were you doing about that?"
[10:20] Mike: "Honestly, I've been watching a ton of free content. YouTube, podcasts, all that. I've looked at other programs but they're either super expensive—like 5, 10 grand—and I'm not ready to drop that without knowing it'll work, or they're cheap courses that seem like they won't actually help based on my last experience."
________________________________________
Rep: "What prevented you from pulling the trigger on those programs?"
[10:55] Mike: "Fear, honestly. Fear of wasting money again. Fear of my wife thinking I'm being irresponsible. And I guess I wasn't 100% sure if I'm the type of person who can actually pull this off. Like, I'm good at construction, but am I smart enough for this online business stuff? That doubt holds me back."
________________________________________
Rep: "So what's shifted now?"
[11:30] Mike: "Time, man. I'm running out of time. My daughter's 7, my son's 5. I'm missing so much of their lives because of work. And my body's not getting any younger. I saw my buddy post about hitting 50K last month, and I'm like... what am I waiting for? Life's not gonna give me permission. I gotta make the move now or I'll be in the same spot in 5 years, just older and more broken down."
________________________________________
Rep: "Yeah and the reason I ask is because there's a big difference between wanting to be that 20K, 30K a month guy and actually understanding and doing what it takes to actually become that guy. Because I can think of being that guy all I want, but it's not until I.. take the actions necessary I won't become that guy. Like, for example, how much do you want to make?"
[12:30] Mike: "I want to be at 20K a month consistently. That would let me leave construction, provide better for my family, and actually have time freedom."
________________________________________
Rep: "And how far are you from that?"
[12:45] Mike: "I mean, I'm at zero right now with ecommerce. In construction I'm making about 5,400 a month gross, so like 20K would be almost 4x what I'm making now."
________________________________________
Rep: "So everything you've done - your mindset, your skillset - has got you to 5K a month in construction. It's not what's gonna get you to 20K in ecommerce, because otherwise you'd have already done that. So is it worth keeping the same skillset and mindset that's got you 5K a month? 
Why not?"
[13:20] Mike: "No, hell no. Because that mindset is a construction mindset—show up, work hard, go home. That's not an entrepreneurial mindset. I need to learn marketing, sales, how to actually think like a business owner. If I keep doing what I've been doing, I'll get what I've always gotten. I'll be stuck."
________________________________________
Rep: "What will happen if you continue being stuck?"
[13:50] Mike: "I'll waste years. I'll wake up at 40, still sore, still broke relatively speaking, and I'll have nothing to show for it except a worn-out body. My kids will grow up and I'll have missed it. And I'll always wonder 'what if?' That eats at me, man."
________________________________________
Rep: "So then tell me what you want, because I'm a big believer that if there's a big enough reason to do something and a big enough consequence of not doing it—that's what gets people to actually DO stuff. So you getting to 20K a month, what does that do for you?"
[14:30] Mike: "Freedom, man. Real freedom. I can quit construction, be there for my kids, take my wife on actual vacations. I can coach my son's baseball team. I can wake up without an alarm and not be in pain. And I can build generational wealth—something I can pass down. That changes everything."
________________________________________
FUTURE PACE & CONSEQUENCES
Timestamp: 16:30 - 20:15
Rep: "Let's say there was a way of possibly helping you with solving this product research and ad problem... what would tangibly be different for you and your business at that point?"
[16:55] Mike:
•	"I'd have a store that's actually making consistent sales every day, not just random flukes."
•	"I'd know my numbers—what I'm spending, what I'm making, what my margins are."
•	"I'd have a system I could repeat and scale, not just guessing and hoping."
________________________________________
Rep: "And you accomplishing that... step into those shoes for a second... what would that do for you... personally though?"
[17:35] Mike: "Man... I'd finally feel like I'm in control of my life. Like I'm not just a cog in someone else's machine. I'd have pride in building something myself. I'd be able to look my kids in the eye and show them that you can create your own path. That's huge for me. And honestly, I'd just be happier. I'm tired of being tired."
________________________________________
CONSEQUENCES OF INACTION
Timestamp: 17:35 - 20:15
Rep: "So tell me one thing man, because you have a big enough reason why you want to do this thing. But what changes is when the consequences are so big that this is either sink or swim. So on the flip side... what happens if you don't? Like what actually happens if you continue down the current trajectory for the next 2 days, 2 weeks, 2 months, even 2 years?"
[18:20] Mike:
•	2 weeks: "I'm still waking up at 5am, dragging myself to the site, coming home exhausted. Nothing changes."
•	2 months: "I'm more frustrated. Maybe I've watched 50 more YouTube videos but taken zero action. My wife's patience is wearing thin."
•	2 years: "God, 2 years... I'm 36, probably dealing with some injury, making maybe a bit more but still broke after bills. My kids are older and I've missed thousands of hours with them that I can't get back. I'm bitter, resentful, and stuck. That scares the hell out of me."
________________________________________
Rep: "And how would you feel at that point?"
[19:25] Mike: "Like a failure, honestly. Like I had the opportunity and I was too scared to take it. Regretful. Angry at myself. And trapped—like I'm living someone else's life, not mine."

Rep: "So this'll sound like an obvious question but it's not. Are you willing to settle for that?"
[20:35] Mike: "Hell no. No way. I didn't work this hard for 12 years to just accept being stuck. I want more for my family and myself."
________________________________________
Rep: "And why now? There's always the 'new year new me' guy. Start a diet on a Monday. Why actually draw that line and make that change? Cause you haven't for the past months."
[21:00] Mike: "Because I'm tired of my own excuses. Because time's running out and I can feel it. Because my buddy proved it's possible and I have no excuse left. And honestly? Because if I don't do it now, I never will. This is my line in the sand."
________________________________________
Rep: "And whose responsibility is it?"
[21:30] Mike: "Mine. 100% mine. No one's coming to save me. I gotta do this."
________________________________________
PITCH PHASE
Timestamp: 21:30 - 26:00
________________________________________
Rep: "Based on what I've heard man—the product research problem, the ad confusion, and your goal of hitting 20K a month—I think what we're doing could for sure help you. If it would be appropriate from here, we can put a game plan together of how to actually get you to that 20K a month. Would that be appropriate or what do you want to do?"
[22:00] Mike: "Yeah man, let's do it. I'm ready to hear what you got."
________________________________________
Rep: [Goes into 3-pillar pitch - Product Selection System, Profitable Ad Framework, Scaling Blueprint]
[22:15 - 24:45] Mike: [Listening, taking notes, nodding along]

________________________________________
Rep: "Based on what I've covered, do you feel like this would actually get you to 20K a month?"
[24:50] Mike: "Yeah, I do. It makes sense. The structure is what I've been missing. It's not some vague 'figure it out yourself' course—it's a system."
________________________________________
Rep: "Ok and why though?"
[25:15] Mike: "Because it's step-by-step. You're giving me the product research formula, the exact ad testing process, and how to scale when something works. That eliminates the guesswork that killed me last time. Plus the support and community—I won't be doing this alone in the dark. That's worth everything."
________________________________________
Rep: "So the total investment man to actually get this system so you can hit that 20K a month and leave construction is $6,997. How would you like to proceed?"
[25:50] Mike: [Brief pause] "Okay... that's definitely more than I've spent before. Is there a payment plan option? Like can I break that up?"
