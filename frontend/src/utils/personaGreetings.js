  Mary: "Hello! I'm Mary. I'm 65 and recently retired from teaching. I'm interested in starting a fitness routine, but I want to make sure it's safe and appropriate for someone my age. I've heard good things about personal training - could you help me understand what that would involve?",
  Jake: "Hi there. I'm Jake, and I'll be direct - I'm extremely busy running my company and I'm skeptical about fitness programs. I work 60+ hours a week and I need to see real, measurable results if I'm going to invest time and money in this. What can you show me?",
  Sarah:
    "Hey! I'm Sarah, and I'm really interested in getting fit, but I need to be honest - I'm on a pretty tight budget as a recent graduate. I'm still paying off student loans, so I need to make sure I'm getting the best value for my money. What are my options?",
  David:
    "Hi! I'm David, father of two teenagers. I'm interested in fitness, but my main concern is how this fits with my family life. I work full-time and want to set a good example for my kids. Do you have solutions that work for busy parents?",
