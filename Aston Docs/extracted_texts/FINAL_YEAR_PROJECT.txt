Explanation of the ML pipeline Flow

1. Input Layer

User Speech is captured via microphone.

Text Input is supported for accessibility/testing.

Upload allows users to provide audio/video/transcripts for persona training.

2. Pre-processing

Speech-to-Text (STT): Converts audio to text (Whisper API).

Text Cleaning: Normalizes and sanitizes input.

Context Builder: Assembles conversation context and prompt for the LLM.

Persona Extraction: Learns new personas from uploaded data.

3. ML Pipeline

LLM: Generates conversational responses (Qwen2.5-0.5B/GPT-4).

Enhanced Response: Post-processes output for persona, tone, and clarity.

Fallback: Provides safe responses if the LLM fails.

Feedback Generation: Analyzes conversation for performance feedback.

Analytics: Tracks metrics and conversation quality.

4. TTS Layer

Text-to-Speech: Converts AI text to natural voice (ElevenLabs).

Emotion-Aware TTS: (Future) Adds emotional nuance to voice.

5. Model Infrastructure

Model Cache: Stores models locally or in the cloud.

GPU/CPU Inference: Accelerates model computations.

Orchestration: Manages model versions and scaling.

Persona DB: Stores persona data for reuse.

Audio/Video Storage: Keeps uploaded files for training and review.

6. Output Layer

AI Voice Response: Delivered to user for real-time conversation.

AI Text Response: For chat interface or transcripts.

Performance Feedback: Actionable insights for the user.

Session Report: Analytics and improvement suggestions.

VoiceCoach AI - Vision & Impact Document

One-Liner

An AI-powered voice conversation trainer that provides personalized roleplay practice with real-time feedback, eliminating the anxiety and scheduling challenges of traditional training.

Unique Selling Points (USPs)

Voice-First Experience: Natural conversation practice vs text-based competitors

Persona Cloning: Upload real customer/stakeholder recordings to practice with specific personality types

Private Practice Environment: Eliminates performance anxiety from peer observation

Instant Detailed Feedback: AI-powered analysis of tone, pacing, objection handling, and persuasion techniques

24/7 Availability: Practice anytime without scheduling constraints

The Problem We're Solving

Every day, millions of professionals face high-stakes conversations - sales calls worth thousands, medical consultations affecting lives, job interviews determining careers. Yet traditional training methods fail them:

Performance Anxiety: 73% of people fear public speaking, making peer roleplay traumatic

Scheduling Nightmare: Coordinating practice sessions wastes 5+ hours weekly

Inconsistent Feedback: Human feedback varies by mood, experience, and bias

Limited Practice: Most professionals practice less than once per month

The result? $75 billion in lost sales annually, 40% of medical errors from poor communication, and countless missed opportunities.

Our Vision

VoiceCoach AI democratizes elite conversation training through AI-powered voice roleplay that's always available, never judges, and provides world-class feedback.

Imagine a world where:

A junior salesperson practices with "difficult customers" at midnight before a big pitch

A doctor rehearses delivering difficult diagnoses with empathy

A job seeker perfects their interview answers with instant feedback

A manager practices giving constructive feedback without fear

Why This Matters Now
