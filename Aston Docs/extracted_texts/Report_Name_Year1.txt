Declaration:

I declare that I have personally prepared this assignment. The work is my own, carried out personally by me unless otherwise stated and has not been generated using Artificial Intelligence tools unless specified as a clearly stated approved component of the assessment brief.  All sources of information, including quotations, are acknowledged by means of the appropriate citations and references.  I declare that this work has not gained credit previously for another module at this or another University.I understand that plagiarism, collusion, copying another student and commissioning (which for the avoidance of doubt includes the use of essay mills and other paid for assessment writing services, as well as unattributed use of work generated by Artificial Intelligence tools) are regarded as offences against the University’s Assessment Regulations and may result in formal disciplinary proceedings.

I understand that by submitting this assessment, I declare myself fit to be able to undertake the assessment and accept the outcome of the assessment as valid.

Abstract

Write 150-200 words that resumes what you did. It should have a single paragraph detailing objective, methods, results, and conclusions without references/citations. The title has captured the attention of your reader, now the abstract will be responsible for making the reader wanting to read your work. So it should describe all that you did in those few words: problem, solution, results, and perspectives. Methods should inform the reader about how you performed the study, detailing the steps you took and the methodological choices of your design, so others may follow your steps and either reproduce, replicate, or repeat your results.

Alternatively, you could use this format (also between 150-200 words):

Objective: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. 

Methods: Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. 

Results: Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. 

Conclusions: Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

Keywords: topic1, topic2, topic3, topic4, topic5.

Introduction

Contextualisation: what is the current context you are working here?

What is a significant problem facing a given stakeholder (cybersecurity officers, managers, developers, society, marine animals) that you want to tackle?

Add a brief discussion of your solution or how you will address this problem

Small overview of outcomes (one paragraph)

Don’t think about “I have to write 10,000 words”  think about the QUALITY of your writing, all the RELEVANT pieces of information you want to write about, working on a good flow of ideas and narrative (a kind of story you are telling). Write some raw paragraphs. Edit your work (read them again, re-read, wait a few hours and re-read). Assess the quality of your sentences. Are YOU enjoying reading or are you finding it too boring? If it is boring to you, it will be boring to others.

This section should have only one to two (at most) pages.

Motivation

Either comment the motivation in this sub-section or in the Introduction.

Organisation

Explain how you divided the work into major sections.

Related work

How others have tackled this problem?

Use *strong* references (from known, reachable, citable sources like Science Direct, Google Scholar, Scopus, or books). DO NOT use blogs, white papers, Wikipedia, or internet commentary or opinionated links.

What is still missing or lacking to do towards this problem? Here you will “make a promise”: what is your idea, what is lacking that would tackle this issue? – this could be in a new sub-section or in an entire new section - careful about the size of this, it should make sense in the report.

Discussion (perhaps sub-section?). Try to answer: how previous work *fit* in your problem?

Adding a citation (Arnaboldi, Czekster, Morisset, & Metere, 2020). To add another, go to Menu item References > Manage Sources > New (don’t forget to add all details correctly, adding all names of the work hitting the button “Edit” besides author, otherwise it won’t cite it correctly). 

To add a new reference: go to References > Insert Citation > (choose from list).

Heading 2

Let’s create a new figure, like Figure 1 below:

Figure 1: A panda sleeping. This is called the ‘caption’ of a figure.

To add a new reference: go to References > Insert Citation > (choose from list). To add this reference, first add the figure (as shown below), then go to References > Cross-reference (choose “Reference type:” Figure and select “Insert reference to:” to “Only label and number”).

Remember to ALWAYS update the cross-references, Contents, and List of Figures.

[Tool-Project-Design]

 (Substitute this title by something more representative of what you did)

Detail of SDLC phases or research methodology

List of features (using software process methodology or frameworks like Use Cases or User Stories)

(Useful diagrams) - substitute this title by the diagram you are describing, like Class Diagram, Activity Diagram, etc.

Implementation details worth mentioning.

And here is Table 1, showing a list of important things. To add this reference, first create the table (as shown below), then go to References > Cross-reference (choose “Reference type:” Table and select “Insert reference to:” to “Only label and number”).

Table 1: A brief description of the table. This is the table ‘caption’.

To create the caption for this table, after creating the table and formatting like above, go to References > Insert Caption (options: Table).

Heading 2

Add a sub-section.

Heading 3

Add a sub-sub-section (remember that you probably don’t need to go beyond three levels).

Results

Add your results here, screen captures (NOT CODE, only important algorithms that help you ‘tell the story’ of what you did). You can add your code in the Appendix (not a capture/image of your code, but the code as text) – Look at Appendix at Section 6.2. Avoid black screen captures.

You could cite an important cyber security tool such as Nmap (Nmap, 2022), for example. Look at References > Manage Sources for learning how to insert new references of this type (Document from web site). Again: you should NOT abuse this: only insert web references from strong web-sites and permanent links, not something that will disappear from Internet perhaps tomorrow.

How users can access the features?

If related, add the experiments you have designed to use/test the application.

Add GitHub/GitLab (etc) sources and links.

Add details about the architecture you ran your experiments.

Usability testing with actual (potential) users

Discussion of results: have you done everything you promised?

Heading 2

Add a sub-section.

Heading 3

Add a sub-sub-section (remember that you probably don’t need to go beyond three levels).

Conclusion (or Final considerations)

Detail what you promised and what you delivered. Be honest, don’t oversell small accomplishments. State the difficulties or perhaps ambition that was not fulfilled. Explain why.

Reflect your achievements here.

Comment the things that worked and the product you have worked on. 

List limitations of your work, useful use cases and audience that may profit.

Wrap up with other important information or highlight features you deem important

Future work

Comment what remains to be done (future work from what you did)

Appendices

Appendix 1: SDLC details

Add other details about theh SDLC not mentioned earlier. Like the original (first draft) of the Backlog, or other interesting things you did throughout the project.

Appendix 2: Code

Add code (most important listings) for your project. Use this tool to highlight the syntax of your code (and add line numbers): http://hilite.me/. Paste the HTML output directly here (fix format as needed).

This is an example of a Code Listing:

5

#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

   printf("I will not say 'Hello World!' here!");

   return EXIT_SUCCESS;

}

Then explain what this code does next.

Appendix 3: Meetings with supervisor

List the things you discussed with your advisor over the meetings.
