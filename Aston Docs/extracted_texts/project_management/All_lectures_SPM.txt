Why Software Project Management module?
• Who has started the Final Year Project (FYP) CS3IP? 
• Do you know that one of the main reasons of failure of the FYP is …
– the lack of good strategies to manage the time to develop the 
project (e.g., following a plan and updating it when required)? 
– the lack of communication with stakeholders (e.g., supervisor, 
tutor)?
Motivation

• Prepare yourself in advance. Ask yourself: 
– What should you do to succeed? 
– What are the risks to avoid? 
– What are the best strategies to follow? 
– What to do if you are confronted with a problem?
• This module will help you to answer those questions
What about your Final Year Project?

Example 1*:
As the software manager responsible for building a new system, you are 
required to tell the sales team when the system will be ready. You have 
25 use cases as requirements, and 5 software engineers who tell you 
that they can have the system ready to ship in four months. 
Do you accept this estimate or not?
*Adapted from Laird & Brennan, Software Measurement and Estimation, Wiley, 2006. 
Need for principled, quantitative approaches


============================================================
PAGE 11
============================================================
11
Example 2*:
You are responsible for making a go/no-go decision on releasing a new 
software application. The testing team tells you that there are 
approximately eight defects per thousand lines of code left in the system. 
Should you say ‘yes’ or ‘no’?
*Adapted from Laird & Brennan, Software Measurement and Estimation, Wiley, 2006. 
This module will provide the knowledge and tools required to take these 
decisions with confidence, based on rigorous analysis of available data

• Software is a relatively new field 
– decades old, compared to thousands of years for building bridges/houses
• Subject to rapid change in tools and techniques
• Difficult to learn from experience when all projects are unique
• Lack of physical artefacts
• Large number of unsuccessful / late / over-budget projects
Why a module dedicated to software project management?


============================================================

• Information systems (used by human operators directly) versus 
 
Embedded systems (controlling a device or machine) 
• Objective-based (client provides problem that can be solved in multiple ways) 
versus Product-based (client provides product specification)
Distinguishing different types of project is important as different types of tasks 
need different project approaches

• Requirements elicitation: what does the client need? 
• Requirements analysis: converting ‘customer-facing’ requirements 
into equivalents that developers can understand 
• Types of requirements  
–
Functional requirements: What the software should do—its main features or 
functions.
–
Non-functional requirements: How well the software should work—for example, 
its speed (performance), reliability, security, and quality.
–
Resource constraints: Limitations or restrictions, like cost (budget), deadlines, 
and technology choices.

A stakeholder is any person or organisation impacted by, or able to influence, 
a software project’s requirements or outcome. 
• Why they matter
– Shape requirements
– Spot problems early
– Provide feedback
– Ensure product is useful and adopted
– Missing stakeholders: unmet needs & higher risk
• Different stakeholders may have different/conflicting objectives 
– Need to define common project objectives 
– Need to agree on an acceptable compromise
What is a stakeholder?


============================================================
PAGE 33
============================================================
35
• Who counts as a stakeholder?
– End users (the ones that use and benefit from the system)
– Managers and clients (sponsors, strategic decision makers)
– Project build team (developers, designers, testers, and project 
managers)
– External groups (regulatory bodies, legal experts, customers, 
suppliers, shareholders, and community representatives)
– Support and maintenance staff
Involving the right stakeholders from the start leads to clearer 
requirements, better software, and smoother project progress.

• Objectives define what must be achieved — not the detailed tasks.
They focus on the outcome, not the activity.
• Focus on what will be put in place, rather than how activities will be 
carried out 
– YES   Deliver an online booking system that allows users to register, make appointments, and 
receive email confirmations will be live by 1st December.
– NO   Design and code a booking website using HTML and JavaScript.

S – 
Specific: concrete and well-defined 
M – 
Measurable, that is, satisfaction of the objective can be  
 
 
 
objectively judged 
A – 
Achievable: it is within the power of the individual or group  
 
 
concerned to meet the target 
R – 
Relevant: the objective must be relevant to the true purpose of 
 
 
the project 
T – 
Time-constrained: time-bound, there is a defined point in time by 
 
which the objective should be achieved
Objectives should be SMART
Example: Deliver an online booking system that allows users to register, make 
appointments, and receive email confirmations will be live by 1st December.

• Given a set of SMART objectives, we want: 
–
Q – quality software product 
–
C – cost: no significant budget overshoot 
–
T – time: no significant delays 
–
P – good productivity 
• Questions: 
–
What is ‘software quality’ and (how) can it be measured? 
–
Can we determine in advance what a project is going to cost? 
–
How do we know if a significant deadline overshoot is likely? 
–
Is ‘productivity’ measurable in a software engineering environment?

• How should we ‘choose between competing designs’ (e.g., by complexity)? 
• How long will this ‘phase of the project’ take? 
• Are the ‘current project risks’ worth addressing? Do we really need to worry 
about them? 
• Which ‘modules’ need extra attention during testing? 
• Has ‘team productivity’ changed over the last few months?

• Why are projects in this department often ‘over schedule by 30%’ or more? 
• Can we ‘reduce future costs’ by consistently using this new software tool? 
• Does ‘Team X consistently produce better code than Team Y’? If so, why?
• Would adopting a ‘new team structure’ significantly improve time-to-market for 
in-house projects?
• Has our ‘cost estimation model’ (used over the last 18 months) been accurate? 
Can it be calibrated for our environment?

• Software projects differ significantly from other engineering 
projects: new field, rapid change, high failure rate & complexity, no 
physical artefacts 
• We need principled, quantitative approaches that can support informed 
management decisions at strategic, tactic and operational level 
• Specific – Measurable – Achievable – Relevant – Time-constrained 
SMART project objectives are required to build quality software within 
budget, without delays and with good productivity

general) 
• This (such and such) has an atypical feature … Why is that? (Can 
we make some positive use of this fact?) 
• Do (…X) and (…Y) exhibit some kind of consistent relationship? (If 
so, what is it? Could we make good use of it?) 
• How do (...A) and (...B) compare? Is one ‘better’ than the other? (If 
so, why?) 
• Why has (such and such) happened (or keeps happening)? 
• If we make (such and such) a change, will (such and such) be the 
(hoped-for) outcome?

• Measurement is the process of assigning a value to some attribute of 
an entity, where the value is obtained on a particular scale
–
e.g. elapsed time of the testing phase of a software package.
• Measurement may require a measurement instrument and may be 
carried out by a measurer
What is measurement?


============================================================
PAGE 56
============================================================
11
• Product
–
Specifications, designs, test plans, modules, programs...
• Process
–
Change control, design, project scheduling, review...
• Resource
–
Personnel, money, hardware, software...
• The fact that we can name an attribute does not make it easy or even 
possible to measure:
–
Complexity, productivity, quality, 
–
Length of time before the program stops (the halting problem)
What to measure?


============================================================
PAGE 57
============================================================
12
• A measurement unit is a scalar quantity, defined and adopted by 
convention, with which any other quantity of the same kind can be 
compared to express the ratio of the two quantities as a number.
–
For example, length can be measured in cm, inches, miles, nanometres...
–
Software size can be measured in characters, bytes, modules, classes,
source lines of code (SLOC)
Units


============================================================
PAGE 58
============================================================
13
• The size S of a Java package to be developed has been estimated at 
10,000 SLOC.  
• The average rate R at which Java code is produced is 500 SLOC per 
developer-day.  
• The number of (full-time) developers N assigned to the task is 2
• How long will it take them to develop the package?

• An attribute that can be measured without the need to measure another 
attribute:
–
Length of source code
–
Duration of testing process
–
Number of defects discovered
Direct measurement


============================================================
PAGE 62
============================================================
17
• An indirect measurement is calculated from direct measurements, 
typically via addition, multiplication, division:
–
Length of a project (length of development + length of testing)
–
Developer-days (number of developers * number of days)
–
Programmer productivity (SLOC / time spent)
–
Module defect density (number of defects / module size)
–
System spoilage (effort spent fixing defects / total effort spent on project)
Indirect measurement


============================================================
PAGE 63
============================================================
18
• A measurement is valid if it is:
–
accurate – measures the true value of the attribute
–
reliable – repeated measurements give similar values
–
meaningful – the measurement answers a question that we want answered
Measurement validity


============================================================
PAGE 64
============================================================
19
• Accuracy is important, but needs to be tempered by context
• Acceptability of accuracy varies
–
If we're measuring file size, we expect 100% accuracy
–
If we're measuring number of defects, perhaps ± 10%
• Timeliness is more important
–
An approximate number of defects tells us whether the software is ready to ship
–
A precise number of defects doesn't add value, but may take time to determine (and can never 
be guaranteed as accurate)
Measurement accuracy


============================================================
PAGE 65
============================================================
20
• We need some way of understanding one measurement in relation to 
other measurements of the same type of attribute.
• The five types of scale that are available are as follows:
–
Nominal
–
Ordinal
–
Interval
–
Ratio
–
Absolute
• Data on a different scale conveys a different level of precision
Scale types


============================================================
PAGE 66
============================================================
21
• This means that the data can only be categorised
• When we compare two measurements, we can say "they are in the 
same category" or "they are not"
• For example:
–
types of defect (data-flow error, erroneous module interface, incomplete module specification)
–
process model (waterfall, prototyping, incremental)
–
operating system (Windows, MacOS, Linux)
Nominal


============================================================
PAGE 67
============================================================
22
• We can categorise and rank data into order, but we don't have a any 
indication of the gap between two ranked items.
• For example:
–
Programmer skill (beginner, intermediate, expert)
–
Survey questions on quality (strongly disagree ... strongly agree)
–
Top-five paying clients
• We know, for example, that an intermediate programmer has greater 
skill than a beginner programmer, but we do not know how that gap 
compares with the intermediate-expert gap
Ordinal


============================================================
PAGE 68
============================================================
23
• We can categorise and rank data points
• We can infer equal intervals between them
• There is no 'zero point'
• For example:
–
Progress across time (P1 = 23/09/2024, P2 = 30/09/2024, P3 = 07/10/2024)
–
Credit scores (no one has a score of zero)
–
Celsius (there is a zero on this scale, but that does not mean a lack of temperature)
• We can say "one week later", but we can't say "twice as late"
Interval


============================================================
PAGE 69
============================================================
24
• We can categorise and rank data points
• We can infer equal intervals between them
• There is a true 'zero point'
• For example:
–
Source lines of code
–
Number of days delayed from deadline
–
Number of full-time programmers
• If you can say "there are twice as many" or "there is twice as much", 
and if zero has a specific meaning, it's a ratio scale
Ratio


============================================================
PAGE 70
============================================================
25

You are assessing the programming languages used in a software 
project. The data includes: Python, Java, C++, Ruby, and PHP.
2.
You are rating the quality of customer service on a scale of 1 to 5, 
with 1 being "Poor" and 5 being "Excellent."
3.
You are measuring the time taken by a computer program to execute 
various tasks in seconds.
4.
You are measuring temperature in degrees Celsius, where 0°C 
represents freezing point.
5.
You are counting the number of errors in a software code.

• Straightforwardly, Pr = output / input
• In software, Pr = S / E (size / effort)

• It's an indirect measurement, but of what?
–
SLOC ignores quality
–
SLOC ignores difficulty/complexity
–
SLOC ignores functionality/utility
–
SLOC ignores task value
–
SLOC ignores those who do not directly write code
• SLOC is easy to measure, and superficially insightful
• What might be a better measurement?

• Estimation is the process of predicting an expected value for some 
attribute (whose value is not known)
• The uncertainty is expressed in terms of probabilities
• Estimates are forecasts or predictions; we estimate what we cannot 
measure
–
the entity whose attribute we estimate may not exist yet or is not sufficiently mature to be 
measured accurately
–
not because we don’t understand what we are trying to measure
What is estimation?

============================================================
PAGE 81
============================================================
5
• Estimation is closely linked to measurement because estimates are 
based (explicitly or implicitly) on data obtained from measurement
• Representational validity and scale types are still just as relevant 
• The most common use of estimation in software projects is resource 
prediction
What is estimation?

============================================================
PAGE 82

• When needed?
–
determining if a project proposal is feasible resource-wise
–
bidding for a contract
–
planning a project: predicting cost and duration, etc.
–
tracking resource expenditure during a project
If estimates are poor, the resulting losses can take a company out 
of business 
Resource prediction

============================================================
PAGE 83
============================================================
7
• In principle, measurements are 'exact'
–
predictions are uncertain
• An estimate of an attribute A lies within some overall range of possible 
values on the scale X to which the (actual) value of A belongs
–
different values on X will have different 'likelihoods' of corresponding to the actual value of A
• Estimates and probability are closely linked
–
Reminder: a probability is formally expressed as a value in the interval [0.0, 1.0], though you 
will also see it as a percentage (i.e., in the interval [0.0, 100.0])
Modelling uncertainty
7


============================================================
PAGE 84
============================================================
8
• Continuous variables
–
Example: the duration of a software project, the weight of a server
–
If we estimate that attribute A will have the specific value a, then a is termed a ‘point estimate’, 
and the probability of our estimate being precisely correct is zero
–
If we estimate that A will have a value that lies in a non-empty interval , then the probability of 
being correct can be non-zero
• Discrete variables
–
Example: number of people, SLOC
–
It is still likely that there is uncertainty - each of the possible values a1 , a2 , …, an may have a 
non-zero probability
Estimates and probability

============================================================
PAGE 85
============================================================

• [L, U] denotes an interval; all values v such that L <= v <= U
–
L is the lower bound
–
U is the upper bound
• The probability P of the actual value a (of attribute A) lying in the 
interval [L, U] is written as:
P(a ∊ [L,U])
• If P(project_duration_in_months ∊ [8, 12]) = 0.95, then [8, 12] is a 95% 
confidence interval
Confidence intervals

============================================================
PAGE 86
============================================================
10
• (L, M, U) is a triple spanning the interval [L,U] where M, the central 
value of the triple, is the expected value of the estimate
• If M in (L, M, U) is the mid-point of the interval [L, U] (it does not have 
to be), then:
M – L = U – M= δ
and (L, M, U) = (M - δ, M, M + δ), which is more usually written:
M ± δ
Example: the estimate for the number of defects in a software 
application is 20 ± 3 per thousand SLOC

============================================================
PAGE 88
============================================================
12
• Iterative prediction technique involving a group of experts
–
Each expert provides an estimate in each iteration
–
The estimates from all experts are “summarised” (e.g., averaged) and the result is 
communicated back to the experts...
–
... and used to come up with a new set of expert estimates in the next iteration
• Estimates obtained by a group of experts are more accurate than those 
provided by a single expert
The Delphi method
12


============================================================
PAGE 89
============================================================
13
• Decompose
–
a project’s software process into phases
–
a project phase into ‘activities’ or ‘work packages’
–
a system into separate subsystems or ‘functional units’
• Top-down: Estimate an overall value and then proportionately 
distribute this over the components of the distribution.
–
When is this appropriate? When the project completion time is fixed
• Bottom-up: Estimate a value for individual components, and then 
obtain the overall figure (e.g. by summing them).
–
When is this appropriate? e.g., for an open-ended or research project

• Effort = S/SpE working the units: (SLOC) / (SLOC/pm) → pm 
• Cost = S x CpS example of units £ but it could also be € (EUROS) - example 
working the units: SLOC x £/SLOC → £

1. Look for a past project (or unit) Q that is ‘very similar’ to the new project P
2. Obtain recorded effort value* E for Q: Q.E 
3. Identify orthogonal factors accounting for significant differences between Q 
and P & expected to impact P’s effort 
4. Adjust Q.E to take into account factors identified in (3):
P.E = Q.E * (Rf1 * Rf2 * ...) + (Af1 + Af2 + ...) 
What might be typical ratio factors Rfi or additive factors Afi? 
–
E.g., size or development rate for ratio factors; different components between P and Q for 
additive factors
* effort might be time, cost, development time, etc.

• We have developed in the past a similar project called Q
• Suppose we know from project Q, that Q.E = 100pm

to develop Q, 100 person-months were needed
• Question: What is the effort that you predict for the new project G? 
• One significant difference between G and Q is size

• 4.1 Identify and describe project products 
–
what do we have to produce in terms of both customer 
deliverables and intermediate artefacts?
–
Typically, a product hierarchy that can be documented 
in a Product Breakdown Structure (PBS)
• 4.2 Document generic product flows 
–
Some products need one or several other products to 
exist before they can be created 
–
E.g., specification must exist before design, and design 
before code 
–
Product Flow Diagrams (PFDs) are used to 
represent these relationships

• 4.3 Recognise product instances 
–
The PBS (Product Breakdown Structure) and PFD will probably have identified generic products (e.g. 
‘software modules’) for which specific instances can be identified (e.g., ‘module A’, ‘module B’, etc.) 
–
In many cases this has to be left to later, more detailed, planning
• 4.4 Produce ideal activity network 
–
Identify the activities needed to create each product in the PFD (Product Flow Diagrams) 
–
More than one activity might be needed to create a single product 
–
Hint: Identify activities by verb + noun, avoiding ‘produce X’ 
–
Draw up activity network 
• 4.5 Add stages & checkpoints/milestones 
–
Ensure that intermediate products are compatible, and project can proceed without major 
incompatibility risks

• 5.1 Carry out bottom-up estimates 
–
Distinguish carefully between effort and elapsed time 
–
Effort = number of staff-days, staff-weeks, etc. required to complete a task 
–
Elapsed time = calendar time between task start time and task end time 
–
Example: If 2 people work on the same task for 5 days without any interruption, then the effort 
is 10 staff-days and the elapsed time is 5 days. 
• 5.2. Revise plan to create controllable activities 
–
break up very long activities into a series of smaller, easier to monitor & control ones 
–
bundle up very short activities

• PRINCE2 acronym: PRojects IN Controlled Environments, version 2 
• Standardised set of process-based project management procedures, 
originally intended for ICT projects 
• Devised under the sponsorship of UK’s Office of Government 
Commerce, and used primarily in the UK
• 1996 revision of earlier 1989 PRINCE framework – recently in 2017, 
emphasis on agility

• Large projects are divided into subsets of project activities organised 
into stages 
–
Stages are managed as a sequence of individual units 
–
Project Board authorises project manager to execute a stage only after the plans 
for that stage are approved 
–
The end of a stage is a decision point when the Project Board reviews progress to 
data and decides that project remains feasible and is worth continuing 
• Project planning activities are placed into seven processes

1.
Directing a Project covers activities by the Project Board 
2.
Starting up a Project comprises activities concerned with reaching a position where 
detailed project planning can begin 
3.
Initiating the Project refers to activities associated with producing an overall plan for the 
project
4.
Controlling a Stage includes the activities carried out by the project manager once a 
stage has been authorised 
5.
Managing Product Delivery covers activities that involve communication between the 
project manager and team managers 
6.
Managing Stage Boundaries includes activities associated with the creation of next 
stage plans & updates to overall project plan 
7.
Closing the Project includes end-of-project activities

• Both PRINCE2 and Step Wise focus on how the project is organised 
and controlled — defining roles, stages, and planning activities.
• Both are originally product-based approaches
• PRINCE2 is process-based, while Step Wise places more emphasis on 
techniques used in project planning 
–
Techniques similar to those employed by Step Wise can be used in PRINCE2, but they are not 
prescribed by the framework 
• Often also compared to PMBOK - Project Management Body of 
Knowledge (PMI, PMP certification)

Are technologies to be used well understood? 
• Look at the type of application being built, e.g. 
–
Information system? Embedded system?

============================================================
PAGE 156
============================================================

Structured approaches 
• Also called heavyweight approaches 
• Step-by-step methods where each step and intermediate product is 
carefully defined 
• Emphasis on getting quality right first time 
• Example: use of UML (i.e., Unified Modelling Language)
Structure versus speed of delivery


============================================================

• Several widely used development process models 
–
‘waterfall’ model /sequential / also known as ‘one-shot’, ‘once-through’ 
–
prototyping / evolutionary development model / ‘try-feedback-refine’, 
‘learn by doing’
–
incremental delivery model /’build in pieces’
–
agile methods such as extreme programming and SCRUM / ‘iterative-
collaborative-adaptive’
Choice of (development) process models


============================================================
PAGE 160

Predictive approach
• "Plan the work, work the plan"
• Everything must be planned
• More control and visibility
Waterfall versus agile
Empiric approach
• "Fail fast, fail safe"
• Based on experience
• More flexibility and learning


============================================================

• The 'classical' model
• Imposes structure
• Every stage signed off
• Limited scope for iteration

requirements are clearly defined 
and stable - no change

• Simple and easy to understand and use 
• Easy to manage due to the rigidity of the model; each phase has specific 
deliverables and a review process
• Phases are processed and completed one at a time 
• Works well for smaller projects where requirements are very well-understood 
• Clearly-defined stages 
• Well-understood milestones 
• Easy-to-arrange tasks 
• Process and results are well-documented
Waterfall advantages


============================================================
PAGE 163
============================================================
28
• No working software is produced until late during the life cycle
• High amounts of risk and uncertainty
• Poor model for long and ongoing projects
• Not suitable for the projects where requirements are at a moderate to high risk of 
changing; risk and uncertainty are high with this process model
• It is difficult to measure progress within stages
• Cannot accommodate changing requirements
• Adjusting scope during the life cycle can end a project
• Integration is done as a big-bang at the very end, which doesn't allow identifying any 
technological or business bottleneck or challenges early
Waterfall disadvantages


============================================================
PAGE 164
============================================================
30
• The most appropriate projects for agile are ones with aggressive 
deadlines, high degree of complexity, and high degree of novelty 
(uniqueness) to them
• Novelty?
• Urgency
• Complexity
Projects suited for agile delivery
Focus is on delivering the 
highest business value in the 
shortest time


============================================================
PAGE 165
============================================================
31
• Agile aims to address several disadvantages of structured development methods: 
–
large amounts of documentation which can be largely unread 
–
need to keep documentation up to date 
–
communication stifled by division into specialist groups and need to follow 
procedures 
–
user exclusion from the decision process 
–
long lead times to deliver anything
–
etc.
Agile methods tackling disadvantages


============================================================
PAGE 166
============================================================
36
A type of agile development process 
• Characteristics: 
–
Increments of one to three weeks 
–
Customer(end users) can suggest improvement at any point 
–
Elimination of distinction between design and building of software
–
Code developed to meet current needs only 
–
Frequent refactoring to keep code structured 
–
Developers work in pairs 
–
Test cases and expected results devised before software design 
–
After testing of increment, test cases added to a consolidated set of test 
cases – reused as part of continuous integration
Extreme programming (XP)
Frequent refactoring
Pair programming
Test-driven development (TDD)
Continuous integration


============================================================
PAGE 167
============================================================
37
• Reliance on availability of high-quality developers (e.g. experience, 
good technical skills) 
• Dependence on personal knowledge – after development, knowledge 
of software may decay making future development difficult 
• Rationale for decisions may be lost, e.g., which test case checks a 
particular requirement 
• Reuse of existing code less likely
Limitations of extreme programming (XP)


============================================================
PAGE 168
============================================================
39
• Main types 
–
‘throw away’ prototypes – used to learn about an area of uncertainty 
–
evolutionary prototypes – the prototype is developed and modified until it 
becomes the operational system 
• What is being prototyped? 
–
human-computer interface – front end 
–
elements/subsets of functionality – back end
Prototyping and evolutionary methods


============================================================
PAGE 169
============================================================
40
• Prototype
–
a model for acquiring requirements
–
a working model built to learn how a work system could operate
–
like physical models in many engineering applications
• Throwaway Prototype 
–
designed to be discarded
–
suitable when the final design is unclear; useful for comparing alternatives
• Evolutionary Prototype
–
designed to be adapted for normal use
–
suitable when the final design is clear
–
built using the intended platform
Prototype terms – key points


============================================================
PAGE 170
============================================================
41
• Learning by doing 
• Improved communication 
• Improved user involvement 
• A feedback loop is established 
• Reduces the need for documentation 
• Reduces maintenance costs due to changes before the application goes live 
• Prototype can be used for producing expected results
Reasons for prototyping


============================================================
PAGE 171
============================================================
42
• Users may misunderstand the role of the prototype 
• Their expectations may get too high 
• Lack of project control and standards 
• Additional expense of building prototype 
• Focus on usable interface could be at expense of machine efficiency
Dangers of prototyping


============================================================
PAGE 172
============================================================
43
• The application to be delivered is broken down into a number of 
components called lots that provide immediate value to the customers 
• Each component is developed as a separate increment
Incremental delivery


============================================================
PAGE 173
============================================================
45
• Several important advantages: 
–
feedback from early stages used in developing later stages 
–
easier to cope with changing requirements 
–
user gets some benefits earlier 
–
project may be put aside temporarily 
• BUT there are some possible disadvantages: 
–
loss of economy of scale – some costs will be repeated 
–
software breakage – later increments may change earlier increments
Incremental - pros and cons


============================================================
PAGE 174
============================================================
46
• Each lot should deliver some benefits to the user 
• Some lots will be dependent on others, hence there is a natural 
ordering of these lots
Typical increment plan


============================================================

47
• If uncertainty is high:
–
Agile or prototyping
• If complexity is high but uncertainty is not:
–
Incremental delivery
• If uncertainty and complexity are both low:
–
Waterfall
• If schedule is tight:

• Activity-based
–
Draw-up a Work Breakdown Structure listing the work items (activities) needed based on an 
analysis of similar past products
• Product-based*
–
Used in PRINCE2 and Step Wise 
–
List the deliverable and intermediate products of project – Product Breakdown Structure (PBS)
–
Identify the order in which products have to be created – Product Flow Diagram (PFD) 
–
Work out the activities needed to create the products – e.g. creating Activity Networks
• Hybrid
–
start from a simple list of final deliverables (which are product specific) and apply the activity-
based approach to each deliverable

• Must have clearly defined start and end-points
• Must have resource requirements that can be forecasted: these are 
assumed to be constant throughout the project
• Must have a duration that can be forecasted
• May be dependent on other activities being completed first (precedence 
networks)
Activities


============================================================
PAGE 219
============================================================
100
• Only one start and one end node – to avoid confusion
• Activities have durations – they do in real-world projects 
• Time moves from left to right – convention to aid readability 
• Loops are not allowed – to enable analysis 
–
Finite loops specifying iterations can be “unfolded”
Rules for constructing activity networks


============================================================
PAGE 220
============================================================
101
• Eliminate tasks on the critical path 
• Re-plan serial paths to be in parallel 
• Overlap sequential tasks 
• Shorten the duration of critical path tasks 
• Shorten early tasks 
• Shorten longest tasks 
• Shorten easiest tasks 
• Shorten tasks that cost the least to speed up

• Identification of the resources required for the project 
• Making the demand for resources more even throughout the 
lifespan of the project 
• Production of a work plan and resource schedule
Objectives of resource allocation

–
Labour
–
Equipment
–
Materials
–
Space
–

Resources categories
Examples resources:
-
Staff, team, developers, managers…
-
computers, hardware, software, tools, or frameworks
-
raw materials, components, or consumables 
-
access to information and knowledge
-
licenses, permits, or regulatory approvals
-
communication tools  
-
basic utilities 
-
suppliers, vendors, contractors, technical support …
-
training materials
-
risk assessment tools
-
stakeholders support
Among others…


============================================================

• The project manager needs to: 
–
Identify the resources needed for each activity and create a resource requirement list 
–
Identify resource types (e.g. ‘VB programmers’ as opposed to ‘software developers’) – as 
individuals are interchangeable within the group 
–
Allocate resource types to activities
• Resource clashes
–
Where the same resource is needed in more than one place at the same time 
–
Can be resolved by: 
•
Delaying one of the activities 
•
Taking advantage of float to change start date 
•
Delaying start of one activity until finish of the other activity that resource is being used on 
- puts back project completion 
–
Can be resolved by moving resource from a non-critical activity 
–
Can be resolved by bringing in additional resource - increases costs
Resource allocation


============================================================
PAGE 226
============================================================
110
• Prioritising is required when several activities are competing for the 
same limited resource at the same time 
• Resources are allocated to activities in decreasing priority order.  
There are two main ways of doing this: 
–
Total float priority – the activities with the smallest float have the highest priority; activities with 
the same float are processed in any order 
–
Ordered list priority – this takes account of the duration of the activity as well as the float
• Typical priority list:
Prioritising activities
Shortest critical 
activities
Other critical 
activities
Shortest non-
critical activities
Non-critical 
activities with 
least float
Non-critical 
activities

• Different focus:
–
Change is something to embrace; we determine what is best for the project as we go along
–
Instead of big-design-upfront and fixed deadlines/costs, focus on client-developer collaboration
–
Keep only the parts of the process that deliver value (no process for the sake of process)
• Examples of agile methodologies:
–
Extreme Programming (XP) (technical excellence)
–
Scrum (management, process)
–
DSDM (Dynamic Systems Development Method) (controlled agile option) 
–
Crystal (there is no “one-size-fits-all” Agile method)
–
Adaptive Software Development – an evolution of RAD (focus learning)
–
Pragmatic Programming (developers encouraged to be flexible but disciplined, mindset)
–
Kanban (continuous flow agile, visualise and optimise) 
What is agile development?

• The most appropriate projects for agile are ones with aggressive 
deadlines, high degree of complexity, and high degree of novelty to 
them
• Novelty
• Urgency
• Complexity
Projects suited for agile delivery
Focus is on delivering the 
highest business value in 
the shortest time

============================================================
PAGE 232
============================================================

• Agility allows a better alignment between business objectives and IT 
• Agility provides gains in terms of visibility, adaptability, business value, 
and risk reduction
• Costs reduction thanks to better effectiveness 
• Time-to-market reduction 
• Alignment with the market and business requirements 
• Control over change cost 
• Longer life software 
• People aware of their responsibilities, more motivated 
• Problems arise faster 
Agile benefits
...but success 
depends upon 
people rather than 
processes

============================================================
PAGE 233
============================================================
33
• Active user involvement and close collaboration is essential 
• Requirements emerge and evolve 
• Frequent delivery 
• System structure tends to degrade as new increments are added 
• Regular changes to the deliverable usually corrupt the structure unless 
time & money spent on refactoring

Success in a scrum depends upon working closely together as a team
• The Scrum framework:
–
Lightweight framework that promotes lightweight, adaptive solutions to complex problems
–
Originated in 1995 (Sutherland and Schwaber)
–
Several books published by both

The three pillars of Scrum
Transparency
Inspection
Adaptation
Scrum
Work is visible to 
everyone, enabling 
early identification 
of obstacles
Artefacts are 
checked frequently, 
as they are being 
developed
Change direction as 
soon as it becomes 
necessary; give up if 
necessary

The team, the Product 
Owner, and stakeholders
The product, the Sprint 
progress, the backlog 
Agile doesn’t fear change —
it expects it.

• Also known as an iteration, these are the units into which large, 
complex problems are broken down
• Occurs over a timeframe of typically 1-4 weeks, with a new 
sprint beginning as soon as one ends
• Team must respect the prioritisation agreed for the sprint 
backlog

• Also known as a 'stand-up meeting', this is a short but essential 
daily meeting involving everyone working on the sprint.
–
Updates on the previous day are shared
–
Plans for the day ahead are shared
–
Anything that has been learned since the last meeting, including problems, is 
discussed
• Run by an individual titled 'Scrum Master'
• An opportunity to reflect and plan, and ensure work is both 
synchronised and relevant to the sprint goal

• The output of every sprint, which should be a deliverable, 
functional, usable product
• Each increment builds on all previous increments; the 
next increment should comprise everything that existed 
already, plus everything from the latest sprint
• Each increment should be a working version of the 
product that could, if necessary, be shipped.

•
Apply Agile thinking – plan in small, achievable steps
•
Be ready to adapt when feedback or new ideas emerge
•
Keep your scope realistic and deliver value early
•
Reflect regularly – what’s working, what needs improvement
•
Document your process clearly — show evidence of iteration and learning
–
From Agile: Product Backlog, Sprint Log or Progress Journal, Reflections
–
From Waterfall (still useful!): Project Definition, Requirements document, 
meetings and decisions log, design diagrams (UML, mock-ups, flowcharts), 
Timeline (Gantt chart), Trello board – keep versioned documentation

• Goal: 
–
Enable to team to share progress with each other 
–
Make visible the blocks (or impediments) - daily - for whole team to see 
• Everyone stands in a circle and reports 3 things: 
–
What did I do since the last Daily standup Meeting? 
–
What will I try to do by the next Daily standup meeting? 
–
Any issues that prevent us to progress? 
• 10-15 minutes maximum
This is the only formal communication each day. 
–
Informal communication may take place throughout the day on issues or things 
that need to change (perhaps via Slack or Discord).
Daily Stand-Up

• No discussion or debate: listening only
–
After the meeting ends, discussion and problem-solving can begin
• Team and Scrum master only
–
Product owner can be invited, as can others, but that's up to the team
• After the meeting, the Scrum Master leads the removal of issues/blocks

35
• Enables projects where the business requirements are hard to quantify 
to be successfully developed 
• Fast moving, cutting-edge developments can be quickly coded and 
tested 
• Due to short sprints and constant feedback, it becomes easier to cope 
with changes
• Daily meetings make it possible to measure individual productivity. This 
leads to improvements in the productivity of each team member
• The overhead cost in terms of process and management is minimal, 
leading to a quicker, cheaper result.
Advantages of Scrum
35


============================================================
PAGE 284
============================================================
36
• Scrum is one of the leading causes of scope creep because unless there 
is a definite end date, the project management stakeholders will be 
tempted to keep demanding new functionality 
• If the team members are not committed, the project will either never 
complete or fail 
• It is good for small, fast-moving projects as it works well with small 
teams 
• This methodology requires experienced team members
• If any of the team members leave during a development, it can have a 
huge effect on the project development
Disadvantages of Scrum

Scrum – Advantages and Disadvantages
38
Advantages
Disadvantages
•
Works well when requirements are unclear or 
changing
•
Risk of scope creep if there is no clear end date
•
Allows fast coding and testing for new ideas
•
Needs strong team commitment to succeed
•
Short sprints and constant feedback make 
change easier to manage
•
Better suited to small, experienced teams
•
Daily meetings improve visibility and 
productivity
•
Team member turnover can slow or harm 
progress
•
Low overhead – lighter processes lead to faster 
delivery
•
Requires discipline to avoid confusion or 
burnout

• Kanban means ‘signboard’ or ‘visual card’ in Japanese
• Lean method for managing work — not only for software.
• Originally used for just-in-time car manufacturing at Toyota (late 1940s) 
where parts were manufactured only when demanded (‘pulled’)
–
This reduced work-in-progress stocks and quickly pointed to any bottlenecks 
hidden by traditional push-oriented schedules
• Adapted for software by David Anderson of Microsoft to handle 
software maintenance requests

Kanban Steps

============================================================
PAGE 288
============================================================
43
• We need to define the pipeline that works goes through 
• For instance, when developing new features for your software:
1. Take items from backlog 
2. Specify the work to implement it 
3. Implement it 
4. Validate that it works 
5. Deliver to customers or partners
Kanban: capturing high-level routine

- work-in-progress (WIP)


============================================================
PAGE 290
============================================================
45
• Just like Scrum’s definition of done
– ‘Done’ means the specific requirements for moving a card from one 
stage to the next
• Examples of ‘done’ by stage:
–
Specify (done): items broken into tasks doable within a day, and quick specs 
done for each item
–
Implement (done): code reviewed and tested, static analysis conducted, code 
is checked in, customer-facing documentation is completed
–
Validate (done): deployment to production, trial by real customers, issues 
identified are resolved
Kanban: define done

• Project manager asks for any blockers and helps solve these
 
(That’s it: there’s no discussion of who’s doing what, as that’s on the board)
• Should take 5-15 minutes
–
Longer discussions can take place separately, involving only those to whom the 
discussion is relevant
• If a particular step or person keeps getting blocked (or takes longer 
than expected), further analysis should take place:
» Was the work not broken up evenly?
» Are there inefficiencies in the process?
» Can someone else step in and help?
Kanban: stand-ups
46


============================================================
PAGE 292
============================================================
47
• Ease of use: Kanban is a very simple and easy to understand approach, which 
makes it practical to apply effectively. No need to be an expert to work with 
Kanban. 
• Promotes continuous and sustainable improvements: Kanban approach 
not only consists of manual cards but also draws visualizations of the process 
outputs which makes the analysis of work easier. 
• Adaptability: Kanban encourages maximum adaptability 
• Collaboration: Kanban focuses on collaboration; this makes the team work 
together to produce the ideal outcomes/deliverables. 
• Low Overheads: Supervision of the use of a Kanban board, cards, and 
analysis of output is easier as compared to most methods/approaches to 
project management. 
Advantages of Kanban

============================================================
PAGE 293
============================================================
48
• Lack of iteration: building software in iterations is a foundation for 
most development processes, which is not integral to Kanban at a 
ticket level. You can build iteration on top of Kanban, but it often ends 
up being its own separate process
• Lack of timing: there are no timeframes associated with each phase, 
which can be disadvantageous
• Dependency on the board: if the board is not updated, or is too 
simplistic to begin with, any advantages that come from Kanban are 
lost

• The chance of exposure to the adverse consequences of future events 
(PRINCE2) 
• An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative 
effect on a project’s objectives (US Project Management Body of Knowledge 
standard – PM-BOK) 
• Risks can be negative or positive
• Risks relate to possible future problems, not current ones 
• Risks involve a possible cause and its effect(s)

• Negative risk involves understanding potential problems that might 
occur in the project and how they might impede project success 
• Example : Key staff are ill at critical times in the project

• Positive risks can result in good things happening; sometimes called 
opportunities 
• Positive risk management is an investment

• Lack of awareness of the approach 
• Unwillingness to spend additional time and resources on risk 
management 
• Development managers may want projects to go ahead and do not 
want project sponsors to be deterred by consideration of possible 
failure
• If successful, you might not experience any tangible benefit, in spite of 
there being a cost associated with its use (which is actually a risk)
Why is risk planning not widely used?

The planning for risk includes four steps: 
1.
Risk identification – what risks might we find? 
2.
Risk analysis and prioritisation – which are the most serious risks? 
– Quantitative risk analysis 
– Qualitative risk analysis 
3.
Risk planning – what are we going to do about them? 
4.
Risk monitoring – what is the current state of the risk?
A Risk Management Framework

============================================================
PAGE 317
============================================================

The most serious effects of risk are:
• Failure to keep within the cost estimate 
• Failure to achieve the required completion date (schedule) 
• Failure to achieve the required quality or operational requirements

• Numeric estimate of the overall risk on project objectives
• Used for projects:
–
that require a contingency reserve for schedule and budget
–
that are large and complex, involving go/no-go decisions
–
for which senior management wants more detail
• Techniques
–
Three-point estimate
–
Expected Monetary Value (EMV) or Risk Exposure
–
Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)
Quantitative Risk Analysis
23


============================================================
PAGE 321
============================================================
24
• A key quantitative indicator in risk analysis and prioritisation is probability
–
Lowest probability is 0 (absolutely no chance - 0%)
–
Highest probability is 1 (absolutely certain - 100%)
–
In practice, risks tend to be one extreme or the other very rarely
• Another quantitative indicator is the cost of the risk occurring:
–
Money
–
Time
–
A quality metric, such as defects per 1,000 lines of code, increasing
• The threat can be readily quantified by multiplying these
–
Probability x impact
Quantitative Risk Analysis
24


============================================================
PAGE 322
============================================================
25
• Prioritisation of risks uses a pre-defined rating scale, which considers 
likelihood and impact
–
More subjective evaluation of both probability and impact
–
Quick and easy to perform
–
No special software or tools are required

• Risk acceptance – when the cost of avoiding the risk is (estimated to 
be) greater than the actual cost of the damage that might be inflicted 
• Risk avoidance – avoid the cause associated with the risk 
–
e.g., buying an off-the-shelf application avoids the risk associated with developing 
the application (such as poor estimates of effort) 
• Risk reduction – actions are taken to reduce the likelihood of the risk 
–
e.g., prototyping ought to reduce the risk of incorrect requirements; or offer 
generous bonuses on project completion to reduce likelihood that staff may leave 
during project

• Risk transfer – the risk is transferred to another person or organisation 
–
e.g., the risk of incorrect development estimates can be transferred by negotiating 
a fixed price contract with an external software supplier 
• Risk mitigation/contingency measures – actions are taken to reduce 
the impact if the risk does occur 
–
need to monitor progress of project activities to identify occurrence of causes of 
risk 
–
e.g., backups can be taken to allow rapid recovery in the case of data corruption

• Addressing a risk usually has a cost associated with it, and the cost-
effectiveness can be measured:
 
leverage = (REbefore - REafter) / cost
• leverage: how much have we reduced risk (should be > 1.00)
– REbefore: the risk exposure cost before the intervention
– REafter: the risk exposure cost after the intervention
– cost: usually money, but not necessarily

Example:
• 1% chance of a fire causing £200,000 damage
• Fire alarm costing £500 reduces probability of fire to 0.5%
• Cost-effectiveness of this risk reduction action?
– leverage = (REbefore - REafter) / cost
Cost-effectiveness of risk actions
33


============================================================
PAGE 329
============================================================
34
Example (answer):
• 1% chance of a fire causing £200,000 damage
–
REbefore = 0.01 * 200,000 = 2,000
• Fire alarm costing £500 reduces probability of fire to 0.5%
–
REafter = 0.005 * 200,000 = 1,000
–
cost = £500
• Cost-effectiveness:
–
leverage = (REbefore - REafter) / cost
–
leverage = (2,000 - 1,000) / 500 = 
2.00

• Risks represent potential future problems or opportunities, and link 
causes to their effects 
• Risks in software projects are related to actors, technology, structure, 
tasks (or a combination thereof) 
• Identified risks needs to be analysed in terms of impact and likelihood 
• High-impact and/or high-likelihood risks may need to be addressed by 
eliminating or reducing their likelihood or impact 
• Risks to the schedule can be analysed using PERT

• To ensure that the project progresses according to the plan 
–
monitor what is happening and compare actual achievement against the schedule 
–
may need to revise schedule to bring the project back on target as soon as possible 
Have you done this during the progress of your Final Year Project? 
• To keep track of changes imposed from outside (e.g., changes in 
requirements)

• A checkpoint is a point in the project where progress is checked
• Two types of checkpoint:
–
Event-driven: check takes place when a particular event has been achieved (e.g., at the end 
of project stages in PRINCE2)
–
Time-driven: date of the check is pre-determined (e.g., between sprints in Scrum)
• Checkpoints ensure that intermediate products are compatible. They 
support project monitoring. 
• FYP checkpoints: e.g., the proposal form and the first report submission

• Dealing with partial completions is a problem
• Estimates are affected by the 99% completion syndrome 
–
developer reports that the task is 25%, 50% and 75% complete at the end of weeks 1, 2 and 3, 
respectively 
–
however, at the end of week 4 it is reported that the task is 99% complete 
• Possible solutions are based on objective verification of sub-task 
completion: 
–
control of products, not activities 
–
subdivide into small sub-activities that each generates a product

Red: not on target and recoverable only with difficulty
•
Amber: not on target but recoverable

• Gantt chart containing the project schedule from the initial project planning 
is now updated and extended: 
–
by shading activity bars to reflect reported progress 
–
by adding a “today cursor” to indicate expected progress

• Neither shows clearly the slippage of the project completion date 
through the life of the project 
• They do not allow the analysis of the project trends:
–
We cannot see how delays are growing or improving
–
We cannot see if things are getting better or worse after we make changes
• This information is essential in deciding what action to take: 
–
In case a delay comes from productivity consistently low (e.g., each week of work from the 
original plan takes a week and a half), the final completion date will keep slipping unless 
appropriate action is taken in the project.
–
In case a delay is a one-off event, a small fix — like adding a team member briefly — may be 
enough.

• Cost monitoring is an important component of project control, but also 
as an indicator of the effort that has gone into the project: 
–
A project could be late because the staff originally committed have not been deployed – in this 
case the project will be behind time but under budget 
–
A project could be on time but only because additional resources have been added and so be 
over budget 
• There is a need for the monitoring of both achievements and costs
Cost monitoring


============================================================
PAGE 369
============================================================
109
• A popular approach to cost monitoring 
–
Proposed by the US Department of Defence for their contractors 
• Each task is assigned a ‘value’ based on the original cost estimates 
–
Often as financial cost, but could be effort - e.g., (person days) 
–
This attribute of a task is termed the task planned value 
• Tasks are also assigned an earned value that is calculated based on 
the state of the task: 
–
A task on which work has not started has an earned value of zero 
–
A completed task has an earned value equal to the planned value 
–
The earned value of a project is the sum of the earned values for all its tasks – a quantity 
that increases over the lifetime of the project
Earned Value Approach


============================================================
PAGE 370
============================================================
118
• The 0/100 technique 
–
Earned value of task is zero until completion, and 100% of the planned value on completion
• The 50/50 technique 
–
Half of the planned value allocated at start, the other half on completion 
• The milestone technique 
–
Earned value of task is the planned value of last milestone achieved 
• The percentage technique
–
Works only if there is a way of assessing the percentage of the task that was completed 
      (e.g., what percentage of 500 data records have been manually typed into a database)
Partly-completed tasks

• Project manager typically allowed to change project plan as long as the 
agreed project outcomes are produced on time and within budget 
• But changes to delivery date, scope and/or cost of project can affect:
–
Users (e.g., reductions in the scope of the project) 
–
The business case (e.g. costs increase reducing the potential profits of delivered 
software product) 
• In these cases, an exception report is needed (unless using Scrum)
–
Written by the project manager to explain the reasons that justify such a deviation 
from the existing plan

• Monitoring takes time and uses resources 
–
Should be applied with different levels of detail/effort 
• We want to focus more on monitoring certain types of activity: 
–
Critical path activities 
–
Activities with no free float – if delayed later dependent activities (although not the whole 
project) are delayed 
–
Activities with less than a specified amount of float 
–
High-risk activities 
–
Activities using critical resources

• Most projects experience – at one time or another – delays and 
unexpected events 
–
Monitoring project progress identifies these events 
• Several options for mitigation are available 
–
Renegotiate the deadline 
–
Shorten critical path 
–
Reconsider activity dependencies: 
•
overlap the activities so that the start of one activity does not have to wait for 
completion of another – this may have a negative impact on quality 
•
split activities

• Monitoring compares actual progress with the plan to detect delays early
• Reporting hierarchy ensures clear communication from team members
• Checkpoints (event-driven and time-driven) help track progress at key moments
• Percentage completion can be misleading, especially near the end of tasks
• RAG reports give simple status but lack trend detail
• Agile boards show task-level flow but not overall project health
• Gantt and slip charts show schedule status but not trends over time
• Cost monitoring shows the relationship between effort, schedule, and spending
• Earned value techniques provide objective measures of progress (PV, EV)
• Exception planning escalates changes to time, cost, or scope
• Monitoring effort should vary depending on float, risk, and criticality

Quality definition and importance
Software Quality refers to the degree to which a software product:
-
meets specified requirements (functional/non-functional) 
-
satisfies user needs and expectations
-
performs reliably under specified conditions
Quality often vaguely defined 
Stakeholders have different views on quality
Common fallacy: quality can be defined and improved later after 
all functionality is built


============================================================
PAGE 381
============================================================
151
• Start with requirements (F/NF) and specifications
• Use measurable, objective metrics to track quality
• Define clear criteria so you can check whether quality goals are met 
Examples of metrics:
• Performance: system response time under 2 seconds, etc. 
• Defect limits: fewer than 5 critical defects per release; less than 10 defects per 
1,000 lines of code, etc.
• User satisfaction: average score of 4.5/5 in post-task surveys, etc.

Termed quality assurance (QA) – 
evaluation of the processes 
behind product development
Easier to manage
Can also be applied to third-party 
software
Is the product good?
Termed quality control (QC) – 
evaluation of the final product 
against requirements
Ideal but difficult – complex 
and costly

ISO 9126: Evolution of Software Quality Standards
• Development of checklists: Increasingly comprehensive software quality checklists led 
to the ISO 9126 standard (1991)
• ISO 9126 updates: Expanded versions released periodically
• Separate documents for stakeholders:
•
Acquirers: obtaining software from suppliers
•
Developers: building the software
•
Independent evaluators: assessing software quality for users

• It is part of the ISO/IEC 25000 series 
• Also known as SQuaRE - Software Quality Requirements and Evaluation
•
This standard replaces and expands upon the earlier ISO 9126 model.
• Expanded Quality Model is divided in two key models:
–
Product Quality Model (8 key characteristics of software product itself)
•
Added security and compatibility, refined functionality and efficiency
–
Quality in Use Model (5 characteristics, focuses on user experience)
•
Focuses on the impact of the software in real-world use
Evolution into newer standards like ISO/IEC 25010

Summary of key points in Quality Management
• Quality is essential in software
• Quality must be built-in from the start, not added as an afterthought
• Quality-related requirements need clear, measurable definitions so we can verify 
them objectively
• Quality Control (QC) checks the product, and Quality Assurance (QA) improves the 
process — both are needed for success
• Modern quality management combines frameworks (CMMI, Six Sigma, Agile, and 
DevOps) focusing on processes: continuous improvement, testing, and automation 
• Best practices and standards improve capability but do not guarantee quality

neighbours dies of solitude.
Each live cell with four or 
more neighbours dies of

Each live cell with either two 
neighbours or three

Each dead cell with exactly 
three neighbours comes to 
life.
Other than a grid that 
begins empty, what 
configuration of cells would 
remain constant, with no 
cells dying or coming to 
life?  The grids can be of 
any size.
How would you go about

MARK the correct answer for the scenario and JUSTIFY your choice.
24
You are the project manager for a software development project that is currently running 
behind schedule. The initial project plan was to release a new software update to 
customers in three months, but due to unforeseen technical issues and resource 
constraints, the project is now expected to be delayed by at least one month. 
Your team has proposed several options to get back on schedule.
A. Add more staff 
B. Reduce features 
C. Extend working hours 
D. Delay the release
Advice to answer questions
Question: Based on the scenario above, which 
option would you choose to bring the project 
back on schedule while minimising negative 
impacts? JUSTIFY your choice.            (5 marks)

Objective: Develop a fully functional prototype of a mobile health app that 
accurately tracks and analyses user dietary habits, achieves at least 90% 
accuracy in identifying and logging food items from user inputs in controlled test 
scenarios, and incorporates feedback from at least 10 trial users to refine 
usability and functionality.
Objective: Develop and deploy a web-based interactive learning platform for 
high school students that supports at least three different science subjects, 
includes real-time feedback and automated grading systems for quizzes and 
assignments, and achieves a user engagement rate of over 70% as measured by 
average session durations and quiz completion rates.

Suppose you have a project with a defined critical path. 
If the duration of one activity on this critical path is 
extended, what impact could this have on the project's 
overall timeline?

Question on risk management
30
In project risk management, why is it important to assess both 
the likelihood and the impact of potential risks? 
Provide an example of how you might position an identified 
risk within a matrix based on these two factors and justify your 
analysis.
Note: revise concepts and risk mitigation strategies or planning 
you would apply for each identified risk; also check examples, 
tutorial exercises on this unit.

This session provided a few discussions as starting points, do not 
forget to check other units content and tutorials.
This lecture session was intended to set your mindset to prepare 
for the exam, and to organise your studies presenting the exam 
preparation materials. It was not intended to provide a full revision
