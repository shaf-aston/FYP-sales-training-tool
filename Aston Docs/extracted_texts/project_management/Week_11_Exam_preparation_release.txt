Conway's Game of Life
Before
After
Each live cell with either 
one neighbour or no 
neighbours dies of solitude.
Each live cell with four or 
more neighbours dies of 
overcrowding.
Each live cell with either two 
neighbours or three 
neighbours survives. 
Each dead cell with exactly 
three neighbours comes to 
life.
Other than a grid that 
begins empty, what 
configuration of cells would 
remain constant, with no 
cells dying or coming to 
life?  The grids can be of 
any size.
How would you go about 
testing that an application 
that implements this works 
as required?

Advice to answer questions
20
Multiple choice questions, some strategic tips that can be helpful:
• Preparation: 
• review key concepts and details from each unit, focusing on 
understanding rather than just memorisation
• practice with sampled multiple-choice questions of your own or 
created by peers brainstorming

Advice to answer questions

Multiple choice questions, some strategic tips that can be helpful:
During the exam:
• Read each question carefully: understand what is being asked, 
especially if the question involves "except," "not,“, “check all that 
apply”, “select one option”, etc.
• Narrow down your choices by eliminating options that are clearly 
incorrect 
• Some questions might relate to practical aspects or techniques, 
use the exam stationery provided to draft and analyse possible 
correct answers

Theoretical questions, some tips that can be helpful:
• Use bullet points (or a table if a comparison is required)
•
DO NOT write long paragraphs with all the differences.
• Be concise!
• Examples:
 
DISCUSS the advantages and disadvantages of TWO agile methods.
 
EXPLAIN WHY software project execution requires monitoring?
 
DESCRIBE the limitations of measuring and/or estimating software 
size using SLOC.

MARK the correct answer for the scenario and JUSTIFY your choice.
24
You are the project manager for a software development project that is currently running 
behind schedule. The initial project plan was to release a new software update to 
customers in three months, but due to unforeseen technical issues and resource 
constraints, the project is now expected to be delayed by at least one month. 
Your team has proposed several options to get back on schedule.
A. Add more staff 
B. Reduce features 
C. Extend working hours 
D. Delay the release
Advice to answer questions
Question: Based on the scenario above, which 
option would you choose to bring the project 
back on schedule while minimising negative 
impacts? JUSTIFY your choice.            (5 marks)

Practical questions, some tips that can be helpful:
• Usually require to apply a technique or a reasoning approach 
covered in lectures, discussed during class, and further reinforced 
through examples and tutorial sessions
•
Revisit examples, applications, in lectures and tutorial questions, as part of 
your exam preparation, and feel free to post any questions or comments in 
the Q&A forums!

Practical questions, some tips that can be helpful:
• Estimation by analogy
• Some complex calculation to establish cost, SLOC, time
• Critical path analysis
• PERT analysis
• (etc.)


============================================================

Applying the concepts to your Final Year Project or to any project example
• DESCRIBE (SMART) objectives of your project. HOW they are SMART. 
• HOW will you measure the success of the objectives? 
• WHAT risks have you identified for your project, and HOW do you plan to 
mitigate them or minimise their impact?
• WHICH software development approach did you choose? WHAT are the key 
characteristics of the management approach you are implementing? 
• WHAT artefacts are you using to manage your project, and HOW do they 
specifically support your FYP management and objectives?
Questions for your FYP (management)

SMART objectives - examples
28
Objective: Develop a fully functional prototype of a mobile health app that 
accurately tracks and analyses user dietary habits, achieves at least 90% 
accuracy in identifying and logging food items from user inputs in controlled test 
scenarios, and incorporates feedback from at least 10 trial users to refine 
usability and functionality.
Objective: Develop and deploy a web-based interactive learning platform for 
high school students that supports at least three different science subjects, 
includes real-time feedback and automated grading systems for quizzes and 
assignments, and achieves a user engagement rate of over 70% as measured by 
average session durations and quiz completion rates.

Question on project planning
29
Suppose you have a project with a defined critical path. 
If the duration of one activity on this critical path is 
extended, what impact could this have on the project's 
overall timeline?


============================================================
PAGE 30
============================================================
30
Question on risk management
30
In project risk management, why is it important to assess both 
the likelihood and the impact of potential risks? 
Provide an example of how you might position an identified 
risk within a matrix based on these two factors and justify your 
analysis.
Note: revise concepts and risk mitigation strategies or planning 
you would apply for each identified risk; also check examples, 
tutorial exercises on this unit. 


============================================================
PAGE 31
============================================================
31
Questions on overall module content
31
Note: revise concepts and techniques of ALL core topics in the 
CS3SPM module; 
This session provided a few discussions as starting points, do not 
forget to check other units content and tutorials.
This lecture session was intended to set your mindset to prepare 
for the exam, and to organise your studies presenting the exam 
preparation materials. It was not intended to provide a full revision 
of all topics of the module. 
For that, any questions, please use the Q&A, e-mails, or even you 
can book instructors WASS meetings. 
We are here to support your learning journey.
