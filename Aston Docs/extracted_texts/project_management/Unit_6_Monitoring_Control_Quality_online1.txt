• To ensure that the project progresses according to the plan 
–
monitor what is happening and compare actual achievement against the schedule 
–
may need to revise schedule to bring the project back on target as soon as possible 
Have you done this during the progress of your Final Year Project? 
• To keep track of changes imposed from outside (e.g., changes in 
requirements)

• The overall responsibility for ensuring satisfactory progress on a project 
belongs to the Project Board 
–
alternative names include project steering committee and project management board 
• Day-to-day responsibility is the role of the Project Manager 
–
aspects of this can be delegated to team leaders 
• A reporting hierarchy that help teams stay aligned

• A checkpoint is a point in the project where progress is checked
• Two types of checkpoint:
–
Event-driven: check takes place when a particular event has been achieved (e.g., at the end 
of project stages in PRINCE2)
–
Time-driven: date of the check is pre-determined (e.g., between sprints in Scrum)
• Checkpoints ensure that intermediate products are compatible. They 
support project monitoring. 
• FYP checkpoints: e.g., the proposal form and the first report submission

• Dealing with partial completions is a problem
• Estimates are affected by the 99% completion syndrome 
–
developer reports that the task is 25%, 50% and 75% complete at the end of weeks 1, 2 and 3, 
respectively 
–
however, at the end of week 4 it is reported that the task is 99% complete 
• Possible solutions are based on objective verification of sub-task 
completion: 
–
control of products, not activities 
–
subdivide into small sub-activities that each generates a product
Collecting progress details: challenges

• Traffic-light method steps:
–
identify key tasks 
–
break down into sub-tasks; assess subtasks as: 
•
Red: not on target and recoverable only with difficulty
•
Amber: not on target but recoverable
•
Green: on target 
–
status of critical tasks is particularly important
• However...
–
Involves estimates based on imprecise data
–
Imposes discrete classifications on a potentially more nuanced situation
–
Takes time

• Gantt chart containing the project schedule from the initial project planning 
is now updated and extended: 
–
by shading activity bars to reflect reported progress 
–
by adding a “today cursor” to indicate expected progress
Task 1 is ahead of schedule; task 2 is behind schedule

• Neither shows clearly the slippage of the project completion date 
through the life of the project 
• They do not allow the analysis of the project trends:
–
We cannot see how delays are growing or improving
–
We cannot see if things are getting better or worse after we make changes
• This information is essential in deciding what action to take: 
–
In case a delay comes from productivity consistently low (e.g., each week of work from the 
original plan takes a week and a half), the final completion date will keep slipping unless 
appropriate action is taken in the project.
–
In case a delay is a one-off event, a small fix — like adding a team member briefly — may be 
enough.

• Cost monitoring is an important component of project control, but also 
as an indicator of the effort that has gone into the project: 
–
A project could be late because the staff originally committed have not been deployed – in this 
case the project will be behind time but under budget 
–
A project could be on time but only because additional resources have been added and so be 
over budget 
• There is a need for the monitoring of both achievements and costs
Cost monitoring


============================================================
PAGE 23
============================================================
109
• A popular approach to cost monitoring 
–
Proposed by the US Department of Defence for their contractors 
• Each task is assigned a ‘value’ based on the original cost estimates 
–
Often as financial cost, but could be effort - e.g., (person days) 
–
This attribute of a task is termed the task planned value 
• Tasks are also assigned an earned value that is calculated based on 
the state of the task: 
–
A task on which work has not started has an earned value of zero 
–
A completed task has an earned value equal to the planned value 
–
The earned value of a project is the sum of the earned values for all its tasks – a quantity 
that increases over the lifetime of the project
Earned Value Approach


============================================================
PAGE 24
============================================================
118
• The 0/100 technique 
–
Earned value of task is zero until completion, and 100% of the planned value on completion
• The 50/50 technique 
–
Half of the planned value allocated at start, the other half on completion 
• The milestone technique 
–
Earned value of task is the planned value of last milestone achieved 
• The percentage technique
–
Works only if there is a way of assessing the percentage of the task that was completed 
      (e.g., what percentage of 500 data records have been manually typed into a database)
Partly-completed tasks

• Project manager typically allowed to change project plan as long as the 
agreed project outcomes are produced on time and within budget 
• But changes to delivery date, scope and/or cost of project can affect:
–
Users (e.g., reductions in the scope of the project) 
–
The business case (e.g. costs increase reducing the potential profits of delivered 
software product) 
• In these cases, an exception report is needed (unless using Scrum)
–
Written by the project manager to explain the reasons that justify such a deviation 
from the existing plan

• Monitoring takes time and uses resources 
–
Should be applied with different levels of detail/effort 
• We want to focus more on monitoring certain types of activity: 
–
Critical path activities 
–
Activities with no free float – if delayed later dependent activities (although not the whole 
project) are delayed 
–
Activities with less than a specified amount of float 
–
High-risk activities 
–
Activities using critical resources

• Most projects experience – at one time or another – delays and 
unexpected events 
–
Monitoring project progress identifies these events 
• Several options for mitigation are available 
–
Renegotiate the deadline 
–
Shorten critical path 
–
Reconsider activity dependencies: 
•
overlap the activities so that the start of one activity does not have to wait for 
completion of another – this may have a negative impact on quality 
•
split activities

• Monitoring compares actual progress with the plan to detect delays early
• Reporting hierarchy ensures clear communication from team members
• Checkpoints (event-driven and time-driven) help track progress at key moments
• Percentage completion can be misleading, especially near the end of tasks
• RAG reports give simple status but lack trend detail
• Agile boards show task-level flow but not overall project health
• Gantt and slip charts show schedule status but not trends over time
• Cost monitoring shows the relationship between effort, schedule, and spending
• Earned value techniques provide objective measures of progress (PV, EV)
• Exception planning escalates changes to time, cost, or scope
• Monitoring effort should vary depending on float, risk, and criticality

Quality definition and importance
Software Quality refers to the degree to which a software product:
-
meets specified requirements (functional/non-functional) 
-
satisfies user needs and expectations
-
performs reliably under specified conditions
Quality often vaguely defined 
Stakeholders have different views on quality
Common fallacy: quality can be defined and improved later after 
all functionality is built


============================================================
PAGE 35
============================================================
151
• Start with requirements (F/NF) and specifications
• Use measurable, objective metrics to track quality
• Define clear criteria so you can check whether quality goals are met 
Examples of metrics:
• Performance: system response time under 2 seconds, etc. 
• Defect limits: fewer than 5 critical defects per release; less than 10 defects per 
1,000 lines of code, etc.
• User satisfaction: average score of 4.5/5 in post-task surveys, etc.

PRODUCT vs. PROCESS Quality Management
PRODUCT or 
deliverable
PROCESSES
used to build the 
product
Did we build it in a good way?
Termed quality assurance (QA) – 
evaluation of the processes 
behind product development
Easier to manage
Can also be applied to third-party 
software
Is the product good?
Termed quality control (QC) – 
evaluation of the final product 
against requirements
Ideal but difficult – complex 
and costly


============================================================
PAGE 37
============================================================

Process Quality Management
• CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration)
• Six Sigma
• Agile and DevOps Perspectives:
–
Agile Quality Management Practices
• Agile Testing Quadrants
–
DevOps Quality Management Practices
• Continuous Integration (CI)/ Continuous Delivery (CD)
Standards and Models in Quality Management
The purpose is to ensure that the project conforms to the mutually 
agreed requirements, specifications, and expectations.

ISO 9126: Evolution of Software Quality Standards
• Development of checklists: Increasingly comprehensive software quality checklists led 
to the ISO 9126 standard (1991)
• ISO 9126 updates: Expanded versions released periodically
• Separate documents for stakeholders:
•
Acquirers: obtaining software from suppliers
•
Developers: building the software
•
Independent evaluators: assessing software quality for users

• It is part of the ISO/IEC 25000 series 
• Also known as SQuaRE - Software Quality Requirements and Evaluation
•
This standard replaces and expands upon the earlier ISO 9126 model.
• Expanded Quality Model is divided in two key models:
–
Product Quality Model (8 key characteristics of software product itself)
•
Added security and compatibility, refined functionality and efficiency
–
Quality in Use Model (5 characteristics, focuses on user experience)
•
Focuses on the impact of the software in real-world use
Evolution into newer standards like ISO/IEC 25010

Summary of key points in Quality Management
• Quality is essential in software
• Quality must be built-in from the start, not added as an afterthought
• Quality-related requirements need clear, measurable definitions so we can verify 
them objectively
• Quality Control (QC) checks the product, and Quality Assurance (QA) improves the 
process — both are needed for success
• Modern quality management combines frameworks (CMMI, Six Sigma, Agile, and 
DevOps) focusing on processes: continuous improvement, testing, and automation 
• Best practices and standards improve capability but do not guarantee quality
