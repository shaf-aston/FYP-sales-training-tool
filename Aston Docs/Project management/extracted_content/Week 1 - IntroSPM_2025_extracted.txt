Why Software Project Management module?
• Who has started the Final Year Project (FYP) CS3IP? 
• Do you know that one of the main reasons of failure of the FYP is …
– the lack of good strategies to manage the time to develop the 
project (e.g., following a plan and updating it when required)? 
– the lack of communication with stakeholders (e.g., supervisor, 
tutor)?
Motivation

• Prepare yourself in advance. Ask yourself: 
– What should you do to succeed? 
– What are the risks to avoid? 
– What are the best strategies to follow? 
– What to do if you are confronted with a problem?
• This module will help you to answer those questions
What about your Final Year Project?

Example 1*:
As the software manager responsible for building a new system, you are 
required to tell the sales team when the system will be ready. You have 
25 use cases as requirements, and 5 software engineers who tell you 
that they can have the system ready to ship in four months. 
Do you accept this estimate or not?
*Adapted from Laird & Brennan, Software Measurement and Estimation, Wiley, 2006. 
Need for principled, quantitative approaches


================================================================================
Page 11
================================================================================
11
Example 2*:
You are responsible for making a go/no-go decision on releasing a new 
software application. The testing team tells you that there are 
approximately eight defects per thousand lines of code left in the system. 
Should you say ‘yes’ or ‘no’?
*Adapted from Laird & Brennan, Software Measurement and Estimation, Wiley, 2006. 
This module will provide the knowledge and tools required to take these 
decisions with confidence, based on rigorous analysis of available data
Need for principled, quantitative approaches

• Software is a relatively new field 
– decades old, compared to thousands of years for building bridges/houses
• Subject to rapid change in tools and techniques
• Difficult to learn from experience when all projects are unique
• Lack of physical artefacts
• Large number of unsuccessful / late / over-budget projects
Why a module dedicated to software project management?


================================================================================
Page 13
================================================================================

• User involvement
• Executive management support
• Clear statement of requirements
• Proper planning
• Realistic expectations
What makes a successful project?
For reflection…
What are some examples of 
unrealistic expectations in a project?

• Voluntary systems (e.g., computer games) versus 
 
Compulsory systems (e.g. the order processing system in an organization) 
• Information systems (used by human operators directly) versus 
 
Embedded systems (controlling a device or machine) 
• Objective-based (client provides problem that can be solved in multiple ways) 
versus Product-based (client provides product specification)
Distinguishing different types of project is important as different types of tasks 
need different project approaches

• Requirements elicitation: what does the client need? 
• Requirements analysis: converting ‘customer-facing’ requirements 
into equivalents that developers can understand 
• Types of requirements  
–
Functional requirements: What the software should do—its main features or 
functions.
–
Non-functional requirements: How well the software should work—for example, 
its speed (performance), reliability, security, and quality.
–
Resource constraints: Limitations or restrictions, like cost (budget), deadlines, 
and technology choices.
ISO 12207: requirements


================================================================================

• Architecture design 
–
Based on system requirements 
–
Defines components of system: hardware, software, organizational 
–
Software requirements will come out of this 
• Code and test 
–
Of individual components 
• Integration 
–

• Qualification testing 
–
Testing the system (not just the software) 
• Installation 
–
The process of making the system operational 
–
Includes setting up standing data, setting system parameters, installing on 
operational hardware platforms, user training, etc. 
• Acceptance and Support 
–

A stakeholder is any person or organisation impacted by, or able to influence, 
a software project’s requirements or outcome. 
• Why they matter
– Shape requirements
– Spot problems early
– Provide feedback
– Ensure product is useful and adopted
– Missing stakeholders: unmet needs & higher risk
• Different stakeholders may have different/conflicting objectives 
– Need to define common project objectives 
– Need to agree on an acceptable compromise
What is a stakeholder?


================================================================================
Page 33
================================================================================
35
• Who counts as a stakeholder?
– End users (the ones that use and benefit from the system)
– Managers and clients (sponsors, strategic decision makers)
– Project build team (developers, designers, testers, and project 
managers)
– External groups (regulatory bodies, legal experts, customers, 
suppliers, shareholders, and community representatives)
– Support and maintenance staff
Involving the right stakeholders from the start leads to clearer 
requirements, better software, and smoother project progress.

• Objectives define what must be achieved — not the detailed tasks.
They focus on the outcome, not the activity.
• Focus on what will be put in place, rather than how activities will be 
carried out 
– YES   Deliver an online booking system that allows users to register, make appointments, and 
receive email confirmations will be live by 1st December.
– NO   Design and code a booking website using HTML and JavaScript.
Setting clear project objectives


================================================================================
Page 36
================================================================================
41
S – 
Specific: concrete and well-defined 
M – 
Measurable, that is, satisfaction of the objective can be  
 
 
 
objectively judged 
A – 
Achievable: it is within the power of the individual or group  
 
 
concerned to meet the target 
R – 
Relevant: the objective must be relevant to the true purpose of 
 
 
the project 
T – 
Time-constrained: time-bound, there is a defined point in time by 
 
which the objective should be achieved
Objectives should be SMART
Example: Deliver an online booking system that allows users to register, make 
appointments, and receive email confirmations will be live by 1st December.


================================================================================
Page 37
================================================================================

• Given a set of SMART objectives, we want: 
–
Q – quality software product 
–
C – cost: no significant budget overshoot 
–
T – time: no significant delays 
–
P – good productivity 
• Questions: 
–
What is ‘software quality’ and (how) can it be measured? 
–
Can we determine in advance what a project is going to cost? 
–
How do we know if a significant deadline overshoot is likely? 
–
Is ‘productivity’ measurable in a software engineering environment? 
Goals of Software Project Management


================================================================================
Page 38
================================================================================

• Level 1: Operational: activity level (short-term) Day-to-day activities 
which vary greatly depending on the project’s process 
• Level 2: Tactical: project level (mid-term) Quality, Time, Cost, 
Productivity 
• Level 3: Strategic: organisational level (long-term) 
–
reducing costs 
–
expanding customer base 
–
increasing user satisfaction 
–
improving productivity 
–
reducing time-to-market
Levels of project objectives


================================================================================

================================================================================
45
• How should we ‘choose between competing designs’ (e.g., by complexity)? 
• How long will this ‘phase of the project’ take? 
• Are the ‘current project risks’ worth addressing? Do we really need to worry 
about them? 
• Which ‘modules’ need extra attention during testing? 
• Has ‘team productivity’ changed over the last few months?
Tactical project questions (examples)
(Project-Specific Issues)


================================================================================
Page 40
================================================================================
46
• Why are projects in this department often ‘over schedule by 30%’ or more? 
• Can we ‘reduce future costs’ by consistently using this new software tool? 
• Does ‘Team X consistently produce better code than Team Y’? If so, why?
• Would adopting a ‘new team structure’ significantly improve time-to-market for 
in-house projects?
• Has our ‘cost estimation model’ (used over the last 18 months) been accurate? 
Can it be calibrated for our environment?
Strategic project questions (examples)
(Long-Term, Organisation-Wide Issues)


================================================================================

• Planning – deciding what is to be done 
• Organising – making arrangements 
• Staffing – selecting the right people for the job 
• Directing – giving instructions 
• Monitoring – checking on progress 
• Controlling – taking action to remedy hold-ups 
• Innovating – coming up with solutions when problems emerge 
• Representing – liaising with clients, users, developers and other 
stakeholders

Components of Software Project Management*


================================================================================
Page 42
================================================================================
54
• Software projects differ significantly from other engineering 
projects: new field, rapid change, high failure rate & complexity, no 
physical artefacts 
• We need principled, quantitative approaches that can support informed 
management decisions at strategic, tactic and operational level 
• Specific – Measurable – Achievable – Relevant – Time-constrained 
SMART project objectives are required to build quality software within 
budget, without delays and with good productivity
