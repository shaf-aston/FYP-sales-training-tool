• The chance of exposure to the adverse consequences of future events 
(PRINCE2) 
• An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative 
effect on a project’s objectives (US Project Management Body of Knowledge 
standard – PM-BOK) 
• Risks can be negative or positive
• Risks relate to possible future problems, not current ones 
• Risks involve a possible cause and its effect(s)

• Negative risk involves understanding potential problems that might 
occur in the project and how they might impede project success 
• Example : Key staff are ill at critical times in the project

• Positive risks can result in good things happening; sometimes called 
opportunities 
• Positive risk management is an investment 
• Example : a new technology developed saving you time if released

• Lack of awareness of the approach 
• Unwillingness to spend additional time and resources on risk 
management 
• Development managers may want projects to go ahead and do not 
want project sponsors to be deterred by consideration of possible 
failure
• If successful, you might not experience any tangible benefit, in spite of 
there being a cost associated with its use (which is actually a risk)
Why is risk planning not widely used?

• Project Risk Management includes the processes concerned with 
identifying, analysing, and responding to project risk 
• It aims at:
– maximizing the results of positive events 
– minimizing the consequences of adverse events

• Actors include people, all those involved in the project - developers, 
users, managers, etc. 
• For example, high turnover/staff leaving leads to loss of information that 
is importance to the project

• Tasks represent the work to be carried out 
• A typical risk is that the amount of effort needed to carry out the task is 
underestimated, so work is not completed by the deadline

• Structure covers management procedures 
• For example, a group assigned a project task is not informed of the 
assignment because it is not part of the project communication 
network, so task completion is delayed

The planning for risk includes four steps: 
1.
Risk identification – what risks might we find? 
2.
Risk analysis and prioritisation – which are the most serious risks? 
– Quantitative risk analysis 
– Qualitative risk analysis 
3.
Risk planning – what are we going to do about them? 
4.
Risk monitoring – what is the current state of the risk?
A Risk Management Framework
19


================================================================================
Page 20
================================================================================

The most serious effects of risk are:
• Failure to keep within the cost estimate 
• Failure to achieve the required completion date (schedule) 
• Failure to achieve the required quality or operational requirements
Risk Identification

Risk Management Technique
Personnel shortfalls

agreements, cross training.
Unrealistic schedules and budgets
Detailed multisource cost and schedule estimation, design to cost, 
incremental development, software reuse, requirements scrubbing.
Developing the wrong functions & 
properties
Organisation analysis, mission analysis, operations-concept formulation, user 
surveys and user participation, prototyping, early users’ manuals, off-nominal 
performance analysis, quality-factor analysis.
Developing the wrong user interface
Prototyping, scenarios, task analysis, user participation.
Gold-plating (superfluous features)
Requirements scrubbing, prototyping, cost-benefit analysis, designing to cost.

• Numeric estimate of the overall risk on project objectives
• Used for projects:
–
that require a contingency reserve for schedule and budget
–
that are large and complex, involving go/no-go decisions
–
for which senior management wants more detail
• Techniques
–
Three-point estimate
–
Expected Monetary Value (EMV) or Risk Exposure
–
Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)
Quantitative Risk Analysis
23


================================================================================
Page 24
================================================================================
24
• A key quantitative indicator in risk analysis and prioritisation is probability
–
Lowest probability is 0 (absolutely no chance - 0%)
–
Highest probability is 1 (absolutely certain - 100%)
–
In practice, risks tend to be one extreme or the other very rarely
• Another quantitative indicator is the cost of the risk occurring:
–
Money
–
Time
–
A quality metric, such as defects per 1,000 lines of code, increasing
• The threat can be readily quantified by multiplying these
–
Probability x impact
Quantitative Risk Analysis
24


================================================================================
Page 25
================================================================================
25
• Prioritisation of risks uses a pre-defined rating scale, which considers 
likelihood and impact
–
More subjective evaluation of both probability and impact
–
Quick and easy to perform
–
No special software or tools are required

• Risk acceptance – when the cost of avoiding the risk is (estimated to 
be) greater than the actual cost of the damage that might be inflicted 
• Risk avoidance – avoid the cause associated with the risk 
–
e.g., buying an off-the-shelf application avoids the risk associated with developing 
the application (such as poor estimates of effort) 
• Risk reduction – actions are taken to reduce the likelihood of the risk 
–
e.g., prototyping ought to reduce the risk of incorrect requirements; or offer 
generous bonuses on project completion to reduce likelihood that staff may leave 
during project

• Risk transfer – the risk is transferred to another person or organisation 
–
e.g., the risk of incorrect development estimates can be transferred by negotiating 
a fixed price contract with an external software supplier 
• Risk mitigation/contingency measures – actions are taken to reduce 
the impact if the risk does occur 
–
need to monitor progress of project activities to identify occurrence of causes of 
risk 
–
e.g., backups can be taken to allow rapid recovery in the case of data corruption

• Addressing a risk usually has a cost associated with it, and the cost-
effectiveness can be measured:
 
leverage = (REbefore - REafter) / cost
• leverage: how much have we reduced risk (should be > 1.00)
– REbefore: the risk exposure cost before the intervention
– REafter: the risk exposure cost after the intervention
– cost: usually money, but not necessarily

Example:
• 1% chance of a fire causing £200,000 damage
• Fire alarm costing £500 reduces probability of fire to 0.5%
• Cost-effectiveness of this risk reduction action?
– leverage = (REbefore - REafter) / cost
Cost-effectiveness of risk actions
33


================================================================================
Page 32
================================================================================
34
Example (answer):
• 1% chance of a fire causing £200,000 damage
–
REbefore = 0.01 * 200,000 = 2,000
• Fire alarm costing £500 reduces probability of fire to 0.5%
–
REafter = 0.005 * 200,000 = 1,000
–
cost = £500
• Cost-effectiveness:
–
leverage = (REbefore - REafter) / cost
–
leverage = (2,000 - 1,000) / 500 = 
2.00

• Risks represent potential future problems or opportunities, and link 
causes to their effects 
• Risks in software projects are related to actors, technology, structure, 
tasks (or a combination thereof) 
• Identified risks needs to be analysed in terms of impact and likelihood 
• High-impact and/or high-likelihood risks may need to be addressed by 
eliminating or reducing their likelihood or impact 
• Risks to the schedule can be analysed using PERT
