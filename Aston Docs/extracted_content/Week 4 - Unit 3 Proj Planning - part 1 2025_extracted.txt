When you have completed this unit, you will be able to: 
• Approach project planning in an organised, step-by-step and top-down 
manner 
• Select an appropriate development and life cycle approach for projects 
• Apply estimation techniques to predict software development effort, 
using bottom-up estimation to avoid unrealistic predictions 
• Produce an activity plan for a project, identify required resources and 
devise work plans and resource schedules

• People are often at a loss as to where to start in project planning 
– Students involved in individual and group projects (consider your own 
experience in individual and group projects) 
– Professionals new to software project management

• Structured approaches or frameworks for software project planning 
address the need for systematic and repeatable planning:
– They list the main steps involved in project planning 
– They suggest best practices for carrying out these steps 
– They indicate logical order of steps, including possible 
iterations or feedback loops
– They remain applicable across different application domains
– Their concepts and techniques apply to manage small or 
large/complex projects 
Motivation for the use of frameworks

• Two planning frameworks covered in the module 
– Step Wise – focuses on planning techniques 
– PRINCE2 – focuses more on procedural aspects 
• Both can be used in combination with: 
– Traditional methodologies (such as Waterfall, Incremental, 
Iterative, Spiral, V-model, etc.) 
– Agile approaches (such as Scrum, Kanban, XP, etc.)

• Developed and enhanced over the years by Robert Hughes 
at the University of Brighton
• Tries to answer the question: “What sequence of steps 
should we follow to produce a realistic, defensible project 
plan for this software project?”
• Scalability
– useful for small project as well as large 
– range of applications including software development 
projects

• College currently outsources payroll processing, which is costly and 
limits data analysis
• Decision made to bring payroll in-house by acquiring an off-the-shelf 
application - supported by a new internal payroll office and small 
software add-ons to integrate with timetabling data.   
• About the decision alternatives:
 
 
In-house versus outsourcing (external/third party)
 
 
Off-the-shelf versus custom-developed
Project scenario: college payroll system

• 1.1 Identify objectives and measures of effectiveness 
– how do we know if we have succeeded?
– From Unit 1: objectives must be SMART: 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-constrained 
• 1.2 Establish a project authority 
– who is the boss?
• 1.3 Identify all stakeholders in the project and their interests 
– who will be affected/involved in the project?

• 4.1 Identify and describe project products 
–
what do we have to produce in terms of both customer 
deliverables and intermediate artefacts?
–
Typically, a product hierarchy that can be documented 
in a Product Breakdown Structure (PBS)
• 4.2 Document generic product flows 
–
Some products need one or several other products to 
exist before they can be created 
–
E.g., specification must exist before design, and design 
before code 
–
Product Flow Diagrams (PFDs) are used to 
represent these relationships
Step 4: identify products and activities
(PBS)
(PFD)


================================================================================

• 4.3 Recognise product instances 
–
The PBS (Product Breakdown Structure) and PFD will probably have identified generic 
products (e.g. ‘software modules’) for which specific instances can be identified (e.g., 
‘module A’, ‘module B’, etc.) 
–
In many cases this has to be left to later, more detailed, planning
• 4.4 Produce ideal activity network 
–
Identify the activities needed to create each product in the PFD (Product Flow 
Diagrams) 
• More than one activity might be needed to create a single product 
• Hint: Identify activities by verb + noun, avoiding ‘produce X’ 
–
Draw up activity network

• 5.1 Carry out bottom-up estimates 
–
Distinguish carefully between effort and elapsed time 
–
Effort = number of staff-days, staff-weeks, etc. required to complete a task 
–
Elapsed time = calendar time between task start time and task end time 
–
Example: If 2 people work on the same task for 5 days without any interruption, then the effort 
is 10 staff-days and the elapsed time is 5 days. 
• 5.2. Revise plan to create controllable activities 
–
break up very long activities into a series of smaller, easier to monitor & control ones 
–
bundle up very short activities
Step 5: estimate effort for each activity

• 6.1.Identify and quantify risks for activities 
–
Estimate damage if risk occurs (measured in time lost or money wasted) 
–
Estimate likelihood of risk occurring 
• 6.2. Plan risk reduction and contingency measures 
–
risk reduction: activity to eliminate/reduce likelihood of risk occurring 
–
contingency: action to take if risk does occur in order to reduce impact

(to be studied in more detail later in the module)
• 7.1 Identify and allocate resources to activities 
–
Record type of staff needed for each activity 
–
Identify staff available and allocate to tasks provisionally 
• 7.2 Revise plans and estimates to take into account resource 
constraints 
–
Staff not being available until a later date 
–
Staff needed for other, non-project activities
The result of these steps is typically a Gantt chart (devised in the 
1910s by American management consultant Henry Gantt)

• 8.1 Review quality aspects of project plan 
–
Ensure that quality criteria are defined for all activities, i.e., criteria that need to be 
fulfilled to sign off an activity as completed 
–
Helps identify and correct problems with individual activities at an early stage 
• 8.2 Document plan and obtain agreement 
–
Ensure that all parties involved understand and “sign up” to the commitments 
required of them in the plan

• Step 9: execute plan
• Step 10: lower-level planning
• Detailed plans are required and feasible for the current activities 
• Detailed plans for later project stages are often not possible 
–
Estimates of effort, start dates, etc. are associated with confidence intervals that 
are too large

• PRINCE2 acronym: PRojects IN Controlled Environments, version 2 
• Standardised set of process-based project management procedures, 
originally intended for ICT projects 
• Devised under the sponsorship of UK’s Office of Government 
Commerce, and used primarily in the UK
• 1996 revision of earlier 1989 PRINCE framework – recently in 2017, 
emphasis on agility

• Large projects are divided into subsets of project activities organised 
into stages 
–
Stages are managed as a sequence of individual units 
–
Project Board authorises project manager to execute a stage only after the plans 
for that stage are approved 
–
The end of a stage is a decision point when the Project Board reviews progress to 
data and decides that project remains feasible and is worth continuing 
• Project planning activities are placed into seven processes 
Overview of PRINCE2


================================================================================

================================================================================

1.
Directing a Project covers activities by the Project Board 
2.
Starting up a Project comprises activities concerned with reaching a position where 
detailed project planning can begin 
3.
Initiating the Project refers to activities associated with producing an overall plan for the 
project
4.
Controlling a Stage includes the activities carried out by the project manager once a 
stage has been authorised 
5.
Managing Product Delivery covers activities that involve communication between the 
project manager and team managers 
6.
Managing Stage Boundaries includes activities associated with the creation of next 
stage plans & updates to overall project plan 
7.
Closing the Project includes end-of-project activities

• Both PRINCE2 and Step Wise focus on how the project is organised 
and controlled — defining roles, stages, and planning activities.
• Both are originally product-based approaches
• PRINCE2 is process-based, while Step Wise places more emphasis on 
techniques used in project planning 
–
Techniques similar to those employed by Step Wise can be used in PRINCE2, but they are not 
prescribed by the framework 
• Often also compared to PMBOK - Project Management Body of 
Knowledge (PMI, PMP certification)
