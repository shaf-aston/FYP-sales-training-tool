Section B — choose TWO of the THREE questions. 
 
Question B1  
A tech company is developing a new customer relationship management (CRM) 
system with multiple phases. The project begins with a two-day ‘planning and 
requirements-gathering' phase. Following this phase, three separate modules—Data 
Processing (D1), User Interface (UI), and Reporting (R)—need to be developed, 
each with specific stages that can run independently.  
The Data Processing module (D1) requires a three-day data validation phase 
followed by a seven-day development phase. The User Interface module (UI) also 
begins with a three-day design phase, after which it has a five-day development 
phase. Meanwhile, the Reporting module (R) requires only a six-day development 
phase and does not need a design or validation phase.  
After D1 and UI modules are fully developed, they undergo a two-day compatibility 
test to ensure they interact smoothly. Finally, all three modules (D1, UI, and R) are 
integrated into the CRM system in a final integration phase, which takes three days 
to complete. 
1) DRAW an activity network for the project described above, including only 
the essential activities required to form a complete project plan.  
Each activity should include the following fields, clearly identifiable in the network 
diagram: 
• A suitable name  
• A duration 
• Earliest start time 
• Earliest finish time 
• Latest start time 
• Latest finish time 
• Float

3 marks for identifying all 6 activities (1 mark per 3 if partially-identified) - Some 
students may identify 8 activities – not keeping them on only essential to the 
plan – receives 2.5 marks. 
 
2 marks for correctly placing all links (ignoring those connected to start/end 
nodes), minus 1 mark per missing, superfluous, or incorrectly-placed link; one 
mark also to be subtracted for each activity in the wrong place.  
5 marks for all top rows being correct (start, duration, end); each column in model 
answer above is worth one mark; don’t penalise twice if an error is correctly 
propagated to the right 
5 marks for all bottom rows being correct (start, float, end); each column in model 
answer above is worth one mark; don’t penalise twice if an error is correctly 
propagated to the left

2) Identify both the critical path and the earliest finish time for the project. 
(4 marks) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 marks: critical path  
Marks can be awarded if the correct answer is based on an incorrect diagram, but 
only if it is clearly an attempt at the full diagram. 
2 marks earliest finish time correct.  Marks can be awarded to avoid penalising twice 
as above. 
3) Consider the following events on the project. Assume that each event occurs 
independently, so while analysing one event, assume that no other events are taking 
place.  
What is the effect of each event on the critical path and project duration?  
MARK the correct answer for each Event with an ‘X’.  
 
Event 1: On day four of the project, it was discovered that the Data Processing 
module (D1) requires an additional two days for validation due to unexpected data 
complexities.  
a. 
 
The critical path is shortened by two days, reducing the project 
duration.  
b. 
 
The critical path is extended by two days, and the project duration is 
extended by two days. 
c. 
 
The critical path remains the same, but the project duration increases 
by two days. 
d. 
 
The critical path remains the same, and the project duration is 
unaffected. 
(3 marks) 
Correct Answer: b.

Event 2: On day 6 of the project, a breakthrough in design resulted in the User 
Interface module (UI) development phase being reduced from 5 days to 3 days. 
a. 
 
The critical path shortens, allowing compatibility testing to begin 
sooner, decreasing the project duration by two days. 
b. 
 
The critical path is extended, increasing the project duration by two 
days. 
c. 
 
The critical path remains the same, and the project duration remains 
the same. 
d. 
 
The critical path remains the same, but the project duration decreases 
by two days. 
(3 marks) 
Correct Answer: c. 
Event 3: On day 4 of the project, a new requirement was introduced that the 
Reporting module (R) needs an initial one-day configuration phase before its six-day 
development phase can start. 
a. 
 
The critical path is extended by one day, increasing the project 
duration by one day. 
b. 
 
The critical path is extended by one day, while the project duration 
remains the same.  
c. 
 
The critical path shortens, allowing for an earlier project finish. 
d. 
 
The critical path remains the same, and the project duration remains 
the same. 
(3 marks) 
Correct Answer: d. 
Event 4: On day 8 of the project, a staff absence means that the development phase 
of the Data Processing module (D1) will take one day longer than originally planned. 
a. 
 
The critical path shortens, reducing the project duration by one day.  
b. 
 
The critical path is extended by one day, increasing the project duration 
by one day. 
c. 
 
The critical path is extended by two days, increasing the project 
duration by two days. 
d. 
 
The critical path remains the same, and the project duration remains 
the same. 
(3 marks) 
Correct Answer: b.

4) Based on the following two adjustments that occurred in the project, evaluate their 
effects on resource allocation, dependencies, and project timeline. 
1. A key development task, which is part of the critical path, has been delayed 
by two days due to unexpected complexities. 
2. An additional team member is reassigned to another module, reducing its task 
duration by one day. 
MARK with an ‘X’ the correct expected effect of these adjustments: 
a. 
 
Adding resources to the delayed critical task may prevent delays on 
the critical path, and shortening the other task allows dependent tasks 
to start sooner. 
b. 
 
Adding resources to the delayed critical task will still result in an 
extended project timeline, and shortening another task has minimal 
impact on overall dependencies. 
c. 
 
Shortening the duration of an unrelated task can help compensate for 
the delay without directly addressing the delayed critical task. 
d. 
 
Reallocating resources from the delayed critical task to start 
dependent tasks earlier will reduce the overall project duration despite 
the initial delay. 
(4 marks) 
Correct Answer: a 
 
Adding resources to the delayed task can accelerate its completion and prevent critical path 
delays. Shortening another task, especially if it impacts dependent tasks or the critical path, 
allows those tasks to start sooner, potentially improving the timeline. 
 
Why other options are incorrect?  
b. Adding resources to the delayed task could help mitigate the delay, not necessarily 
extend the timeline. Shortening a task could have a significant impact if it affects 
dependencies or is on the critical path. 
c. If the delayed task is on the critical path, unrelated tasks won’t offset its delay. Only 
tasks affecting the critical path or dependencies can help compensate. 
d. Reallocating resources away from a delayed critical task would likely worsen its 
delay, further impacting the project timeline.

5) DISCUSS the advantages and disadvantages of using an off-the-shelf solution – 
as opposed to a bespoke solution – when creating an online learning platform. 
(5 marks) 
An off-the-shelf solution for an online learning platform offers quick setup, lower 
costs, regular updates, and technical support. However, it limits customisation, 
creates dependency on the provider, may include unwanted features, and could 
struggle with scalability. In contrast, a bespoke solution is fully tailored to specific 
needs but requires more time, expense, and maintenance.

5) A project P2 is currently underway, which is similar to an earlier project P1.  
Project P1 comprised 30,000 SLOC. 
On project P1, the team produced code at a rate of 750 SLOC/person-month. 
Project P2 is estimated to be 54,000 ± 3,500 SLOC.  However, the team includes 
some new developers, which the current team leader estimates will add fifteen 
percent to the effort required. 
Given that the team comprises twelve full-time employees, how long should project 
P2 take to complete?   
Your answer should be in the form: 
(best-case, likely-case, worst-case) 
(10 marks) 
1 mark for each calculation, 1 mark for answer, don’t penalise a carried forward 
mistake twice 
30,000 / 750 = 40 person-months (2 marks) 
40 / 30,000 * 54,000 = 72 person-months (2 marks) 
72 * 1.15 = 82.8 person-months (2 marks) 
82.8 / 12 = 6.9 months (2 marks)

6) A new team is being formed within a company, with the plan being for that team to 
work together on many software projects. 
The team leader is keen to gather measurements of early projects, in order to 
increase the accuracy of predictions within later projects. 
IDENTIFY two direct measurements and two indirect measurements that might be 
collected from earlier projects.  For each indirect measurement, EXPLAIN how it 
would increase the accuracy of predictions within later projects. 
(8 marks) 
Examples of direct measurements: SLOC, person-months (or similar), cost (2 marks) 
Examples of indirect measurements: any calculation that uses another measurement 
as an input, such as cost per person-month (2 marks) 
Valid description of use in informing predictions, with (1 mark) for a valid use and (1 
mark) for explaining that use, e.g.: 
• Cost per person-month would allow effort to be predicted (1 mark) by dividing 
the cost of a later project by the cost-per-person-month of the earlier project 
(1 mark) 
• SLOC per £1,000 would allow SLOC to be predicted (1 mark) by dividing 
SLOC-per-£1000 by SLOC (1 mark)

Question B3 
 
1) Based on the software development project scenario described below. 
PLACE each identified risk in the appropriate position on the Risk Matrix (Likelihood 
vs. Impact) and PROVIDE a brief justification for each placement.  
 
Project scenario: a healthcare software development, which has strict regulatory 
requirements, a hands-on client, a fixed budget, and reliance on third-party 
integration. 
Identified risks: 
1. Scope creep due to changing client requirements. 
2. Budget overruns due to underestimated costs. 
3. Team burnout or turnover midway through the project. 
4. Minor delays in receiving non-critical client feedback. 
5. Need for additional training on new tools or technology. 
 
Instructions: Use the provided Risk Matrix to assign each risk to the correct position, 
categorising each by Likelihood (Low or High) and Impact (Low or High). 
Risk Matrix 
High Impact 
Low Impact 
High Likelihood 
1,2,3 
5 
Low Likelihood 
3 
4 
 
Justifications: 
 
2 marks for each risk: correctly placed (1 mark) with justification (1 mark)  
  
Possible justifications:  
1.HH/ With a hands-on client, there is a high likelihood that requirements may evolve, leading to 
scope creep. In a healthcare project with strict regulatory requirements, any scope changes could 
significantly impact the timeline and compliance, making the impact high.  
2.HH/ Given the fixed budget, the risk of budget overruns is high if initial cost estimations are off, 
especially with additional regulatory and integration requirements. Budget overruns would directly 
threaten project completion or force cuts in quality, so the impact is also high.  
3.H/H/ In a high-stakes healthcare project with strict deadlines, regulatory pressure, there is a high 
chance of team burnout. Team burnout could lead to delays and knowledge gaps, impacting the 
project’s progress significantly.  
OR 3. L/H / if managed effectively (with proactive strategies like workload balancing, adequate rest 
periods, and team support, the likelihood of burnout or turnover could be minimised; If 
burnout/turnover does occur, it would have a significant impact, potentially leading to delays, 
knowledge loss, drop in productivity, all of which could jeopardise the project’s timeline and quality)

4.L/L/ Since the feedback is “non-critical,” minor delays here are less likely to affect the project’s 
timeline or major deliverables. The impact of such delays would be minimal, and it is reasonable to 
assume these delays will occur less frequently.  
5.H/L/ Given the likelihood of new tools in a tech-driven healthcare project, training needs are 
relatively high. However, since training can be planned for and mitigated without directly impacting the 
project’s main deliverables, the impact on overall project success is low.

2) Consider the risks below identified in CS Final Year Projects (FYP).  
LIST two effective mitigation strategies for each risk that could help minimise its 
impact or likelihood in a software development project. 
 
Risk 1: Lack of technical skills needed for implementation 
Risk 2: Insufficient testing leading to undetected errors 
Risk 3: Poor time management leading to missed deadlines 
 
(9 marks) 
 
Possible solution  1.5 mark each strategy / 3 marks per risk evaluation 
 
1. Identify required skills early, dedicate time to self-learning, seek mentorship. Allocating 
a few hours each week for learning essential tools and technologies; these can help 
build necessary skills gradually rather than encountering gaps later in the 
project....etc... 
2. Develop testing plans with milestones for regular unit testing, integration testing, and 
final/other testing. Setting up automated tests (where possible); peer reviews will help 
on quality checks and reduce the risk of major errors near the project deadline... 
3. Create a detailed project schedule with clear milestones, breaking down tasks into 
manageable weekly goals, e.g. Regularly review and adjust the timeline, using tools 
like Gantt charts or task management software to stay on track. Scheduling weekly 
check-ins with a supervisor or peer can also provide accountability and help identify 
potential delays early.

3) Which of the following options best represents effective risk management 
practices?  
MARK with an ‘X’ the most accurate answer:  
a. 
 
Identifying risks at the beginning of the project only, as risks 
discovered later may not affect the project.   
b. 
 
Regularly reviewing and updating the risk management plan 
throughout the project to address new or changing risks, with specific 
mitigation strategies for high-impact risks. 
c. 
 
Avoiding risk assessments in the early stages of a project to avoid 
potential delays and costs associated with risk planning. 
d. 
 
Focusing solely on high-likelihood risks, as low-likelihood risks are 
unlikely to impact project outcomes. 
(3 marks) 
Correct answer: b 
 
4) A company has identified a cybersecurity threat, and is considering purchasing a 
software tool that would reduce that threat. 
The threat relates to a specific type of injection attack, which has a 10.5% likelihood 
of taking place, and would result in a loss of revenue of £150,000.  If the tool is 
purchased, at a cost of £5,000, the likelihood of such an attack drops to 6.9%. 
Perform an analysis to ascertain the cost-effectiveness of purchasing the software 
tool.  You should show all of your working, and you should make a clear go/no-go 
decision, with a justification of that decision. 
(6 marks) 
1 mark for any attempt to multiply impact by probability 
1 mark for RE(before) as £15,750 
1 mark for RE(after) as £10,350 
1 mark for subtraction operation (even if input values are incorrect) 
1 mark for a go decision – can only be awarded if there is a meaningful attempt at 
the calculation (not for a lucky guess) 
1 mark for justification (5,400 > 5,000 or leverage = 1.08, or similar)

Formulas: 
 
PERT technique  
Activity expected time te = (L + 4M +U) / 6 
Activity variance v = ((U – L) / 6) ^ 2 
For a sequence/chain of activities: 
te = te (A1) + te (A2) + … + te (An) and v = v(A1) + v(A2) + … v(An) 
For activities running concurrently: 
te = max (te (A1), te (A2), …, te (An)) and v = max (v(A1), v(A2), …, v(An)) 
Given a target deadline T, the z value for an activity, a set of activities or an entire 
project is given by z = (T – te) / sqrt(v), where te and v are the PERT expected time 
and variance respectively. 
 
Measurement, estimation and data analysis 
Effort = S x EpS    
Effort = S/SpE  
Cost = S x CpS   
Cost = Effort x CpE 
New Project Effort = Old Project Effort * (Rf1 * Rf2 * ...) + (Af1 + Af2 + ...)
