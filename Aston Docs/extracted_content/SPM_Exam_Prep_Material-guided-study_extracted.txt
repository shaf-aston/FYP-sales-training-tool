CS3SPM Exam Personal Study Material 
Software Project Management 
 
 
 
 
This material provides valuable insights to aid in your exam preparation. While it offers 
useful guidance, it is not meant to serve as your sole preparation resource. In addition to 
this material, it's essential to incorporate all the topics covered in both lectures and tutorials 
into your exam preparation.  
 
The intention behind this resource is to assist you in navigating through the lecture slides 
efficiently, preventing the need to review a large volume of slides aimlessly. Also, remember 
that you have access to lecture recordings and short support videos, which can be 
beneficial. We trust that you will find this material helpful.  
 
Included below are a set of questions and exercises designed to assist you as you 
prepare for the exam. However, please note that this is just a guide. As mentioned 
earlier, we encourage proactive studying and recommend using the slides provided 
during lectures and tutorials as a fundamental part of your preparation process.

retrospective). 
• 
COMPARE Product and Sprint Backlogs. 
• 
EXPLAIN Disadvantages and Advantages of Scrum.

PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE of applying Scrum/Kanban to your FYP or any other project 
SMART goals and objectives. 
• 
WRITE a short paragraph (MAX 6-8 lines) describing the goal and context of your Final 
Year Project or any other project. Then: DESCRIBE at least THREE SMART objectives of 
this project, being careful to explain each of the 5 properties denoted by the SMART 
acronym but paying particular attention to the property denoted by “M” (in other words 
how will you check or know that you have succeeded with that objective?) 
• 
For the same project: DESCRIBE at least FOUR project risks, classify them in terms of 
likelihood and impact, and list possible mitigations for these risks. 
 
 
Risk Management 
• 
EXPLAIN WHAT are the top 10 software development risks according to Barry Boehm? 
Also, explain the risk reduction techniques used for each of the 10 risk categories. 
• 
NAME the benefits of risk planning. 
• 
EXPLAIN WHY is risk planning not widely used? 
• 
Briefly DESCRIBE 4 mitigation strategies to get a given software project back on track 
when the project has experienced delays due to unexpected events. 
• 
EXPLAIN the steps to follow while planning for risk? What does each step cover?

EXPLAIN WHAT is risk exposure? What is risk reduction leverage? 
• 
DEFINE risk and risk management in the context of software projects. 
• 
WHAT are the categories of risk? 
• 
WHAT are the approaches to identify risks? 
• 
DESCRIBE the FOUR categories of risk in software projects 
• 
Given any software development project as an example (e.g., a final-year undergraduate 
project whose objective is to develop a web site for booking appointments, or your own 
project idea or FYP): 
• 
IDENTIFY FOUR risks associated.  
• 
ASSESS the likely probability level and impact level of EACH of these risks.

(remember examples of solution have been published on Blackboard).  
 
Some of the module content also have short videos as complementary resources. 
 
Specifically, take special care while preparing exercise problems that cover the following:

class, such as effort = system_size / productivity. 
• 
Unit 3: Planning:

• 
Risk identification, Risk matrix 
• 
Calculation of the risk exposure factor 
• 
Application of the Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT), including the 
use of the table with z values.

Formulas and Z-score Table (provided in the exam paper): 
PERT technique  
Activity expected time te = (L + 4M +U) / 6 
Activity variance v = ((U – L) / 6) ^ 2 
For a sequence/chain of activities: 
te = te (A1) + te (A2) + … + te (An) and v = v(A1) + v(A2) + … v(An) 
For activities running concurrently: 
te = max (te (A1), te (A2), …, te (An)) and v = max (v(A1), v(A2), …, v(An)) 
Given a target deadline T, the z value for an activity, a set of activities or an 
entire project is given by z = (T – te) / sqrt(v), where te and v are the PERT 
expected time and variance respectively. 
 
Measurement, estimation and data analysis 
Effort = S x EpS    
Effort = S/SpE  
Cost = S x CpS   
Cost = Effort x CpE 
New Project Effort = Old Project Effort * (Rf1 * Rf2 * ...) + (Af1 + Af2 + ...)
